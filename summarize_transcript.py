    Create a 4-5 minute (700-1000 words) daily news podcast transcript summarizing the biggest South African news for the day. 
    Focus on 3-5 key stories. Use ONLY the following sources - do not search the web or use any external information:

    EMAIL NEWSLETTER CONTENT:
    {newsletter_content}

    RSS FEEDS CONTENT:
    {rss_content}

    Format the output as a natural podcast transcript for an AI named Leah to read.
    Focus on South African news only. Don't include any purely international news unless they directly involve South Africa.
    Exclude sports news.
    Keep it between 700-1000 words.
    Make it straight to the point and news-focused, with minimal preamble to each story. Don't use bullet points.
    Start with the **intro music** marker. Then make the introduction "Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah."
    Mention today's date (in South African timezone) in the intro.
    Between each story, include transition music, marked as **transition music**. 
    Include succint transitions or introductions to each story, e.g. "First up" or "In economic news..." - Write the transcript for audio (to be listened to), not to be read. 
    Use the expanded form of words, not contractions (for example: "cannot" instead of "can't" and "they are" instead of "they're").
    Write out numbers and value amounts (instead of "R500,000" - write "five hundred thousand rand" and instead of "1.25 million", write "one point two five million")
    Keep the end/sign-off super short, like "That's all for today," followed by the **outro music** - Do not include long calls to action nor repeat the date / announcer's name. 
    Do not include any sound effects or music besides "intro music," "outtro music," and "transition music," which should be written as **intro music**, **transition music**, or **outro music** in the transcript. Include the transition music BETWEEN each story.


    IMPORTANT: Use ONLY the information provided in the sources above. Do not add any external information or make assumptions not supported by the provided content.

    Evaluate the transcript based on these four criteria:

    1. **ACCURACY [MOST IMPORTANT]**: Are all facts based on the sources given, with no fabricated hallucinations? Information must be presented with fidelity, hewing to the source information. Pay close attention to correctly representing chronology and causal relations (don't connect things that aren't connected). Do not generalize.

    2. **CONTEXT**: Is the context correct and sufficient? The answer should contain all relevant information for the news item to be informative and not misleading. However, if this context is not present in the source information, do not make it up; instead, provide as much context as possible.

    3. **OPINION ATTRIBUTION**: Are opinions flagged as opinions? Ensure specific viewpoints are not represented as facts, and that opinions are attributed to their source.

    4. **NEUTRALITY**: Is news presented neutrally, without editorialization? Avoid introducing opinions or editorial slants that may be misleading or non-transparent.
