ARTICLE 2 (Mail & Guardian)
Title: SA scientists release promising HIV cure trial results
Description: The study found 20% of women who took a drug intervention that included antibodies remained virally suppressed without antiretroviral therapy after 18 months.
Full Content: <p class="has-drop-cap">South African scientists have released the findings of the first HIV cure trial in Africa with promising results showing viral suppression in 20% of women who stopped taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) after 18 months.</p><p>The study involved 20 women who tested positive for HIV at the Females Rising through Education, Support and Health <a href="https://ragoninstitute.org/fresh/">(Fresh)</a> clinic in Umlazi, KwaZulu-Natal, and started taking antiretroviral treatment a day after knowing their status.</p><p>The women aged between 23 and 32 and were living with HIV-1 subtype C, the most common HIV-1 strain in Southern African, which also represents 50% of infections worldwide.</p><p>They had been on antiretroviral therapy for at least six years before they joined the study, which involved stopping the therapy and started taking an “intervention” of three products.&nbsp; The study was conducted from July 2022 to January 2024.</p><p>According to the research findings, 20% of participants (four women) were able to control viral load to undetectable for a median of 1.5 years after they stopped taking antiretrovirals (ARVs), while 80% did not control their viral load and had to restart them. Viral suppression is defined as having less than 200 copies of HIV per millilitre of blood, which helps keep the infected person healthy and prevents transmission.</p><p>The research and laboratory investigation was led by the <a href="https://mg.co.za/tag/ukzn/">University of KwaZulu-Natal</a>’s Africa Health Research Institute director for basic and translational science Professor Thumbi Ndung’u.</p><p>He said the objective of the study was to assess the safety and efficacy of the product “intervention”, which included two broadly neutralising antibodies — VRC07-523LS and CAP256V2LS — that bind to HIV and stop it, as well as Vesatolimod, which binds to human immune cells and activates the immune response against HIV.</p><p>At the presentation of the findings on Friday, he said the hope was to test the immune response to develop an alternative treatment that people could take for two to three years rather than having to take ARV every day for the rest of their lives.</p><p>“We first confirmed in the laboratory whether the virus&nbsp; could be inhibited with the two antibodies and the women’s <a href="https://mg.co.za/tag/cd4-count/">CD4 count</a> (the measure of a type of white blood cells crucial for fighting infections) had to be above 500. Safety was very important because it was the first time that the three drugs were being tested,” Ndung’u said.</p><p>“We then asked the participants under close medical observation to stop antiretroviral therapy, to see whether the virus will rebound. It was a small study, but what we found is that four out of 20 participants were able to control the virus without anti-retrovial therapy,” he said.</p><p>“This is not a cure for HIV, because we cannot give patients something that only worked in 20% of participants, but it is a step in the right direction. We hope we can improve on this approach and maybe next time do study where we can have 50%.</p><p>He said Africa was taking the lead in developing solutions and that while this product would not be tested further, “there might be other products coming out further along”.</p><p>Because the participants had started antiretroviral therapy within a day of being diagnosed with HIV, their bodies’ immune systems had had very little exposure to the virus.</p><p>“We wanted to see how long it takes for the viral load to rebound. If you stop taking ARV today, within two weeks the virus will rebound,” Ndung’u said.&nbsp;</p><p>When the virus rebounded to a viral load of 1000 within 16 weeks for seven of the participants, they went back onto&nbsp; antiretroviral therapy.</p><p>“So, we can say they did relatively well compared to someone who just stops treatment and then we had another group of seven that took between 16 weeks and 44 weeks for the virus to rebound which was when the study was meant to end. They went back onto ART and there was no problem with drug resistance,” he said.</p><p>None of the participant’s <a href="https://mg.co.za/tag/cd4-count/">CD4 counts</a> dropped below 350 before they were put back on&nbsp; antiretroviral therapy, so their immune systems were still healthy. Six participants did not need to restart treatment after 44 weeks and of those, four finished an entire year without needing to start ARVs.</p><p>The four women chose to remain off ARVs under close clinical monitoring, visiting the clinic once a week, and 18 months later still showed no signs of the virus while one woman went on to reach 2.5 years without the virus rebounding.</p><p>According to United Nations Aids statistics, sub-Saharan Africa remains the region most heavily affected by HIV worldwide, accounting for 67%, of which about 53% are women.</p><p>dung’u said most clinical HIV cure trials around the world, largely in the United States, have focused on Caucasian men, which is why it had been important to do a study with women.</p><p>“Women represent less than 20% of participants in HIV cure trials. So that means that the products being tested, if they don&#8217;t work in women, or if they cause some side effects in women we would not know, and that&#8217;s why it was very important for us to do this study to see whether we can induce ART free control of HIV in women, “ he said.</p><p>Professor Krista Dong, of Fresh, said the “complicated” trial was particularly important because of the dearth of HIV research involving women in Southern Africa.</p><p>“We have no idea really, whether an intervention that we put in Caucasian men in San Francisco is going to work in a 13-year-old girl in Umlazi,” she said.</p><p>“We do know that there are differences, hormonal differences, and differences culturally, where say, someone in San Francisco will pop a pill for PrEP [pre-exposure prophylaxis, taken to prevent getting HIV from sex or injection drug use] every day, whereas women say no, that&#8217;s not for us, we prefer injection. You have to consider the local context.”</p>

ARTICLE 3 (Mail & Guardian)
Title: Truth and lies in the GNU faux pas
Description: Here and worldwide people are feeling detached from society and lonely, so they grab onto populist political leaders and parties
Full Content: <p class="has-drop-cap">Let us not be like the 1980s song Little Lies by super group Fleetwood Mac. I can just about hear Christine McVie belting out on vocals, “Tell me lies, tell me sweet little lies.” South Africans may joke a lot but we prefer the cold, hard truth to sweet, convenient lies.</p><p>In the next few months the focus will be on the G20. We must expect sweet lies from Europe, especially the European Commission, promising us all sorts of help as US President Donald Trump ratchets up his disdain for South Africa. Others opposed to the West will also be telling us to join ourselves at the hip with China and Russia.&nbsp;</p><p>We need to be smarter than this. None of them — the Europeans, China, Russia or even if we capitulate to Trump, the US, will actually help us. Steve Biko’s statement, “Black man, you are on your own,” is so apt. Their help will come at the cost of us losing more of our very little self-reliance and, in many ways, our dignity.</p><p>I fear though, because many of us feel so lost and lack confidence, we may be guilty of grasping at straws and sweet little lies to soothe our broken hearts.</p><p>As we know there was no outright winner in the 2024 elections. A faux “government of national unity” was established. I refer to it as a faux, or false, GNU because it is, in reality, a coalition. Labelling the coalition a government of national unity is a trick to pull on our heartstrings and remind us of 1994 and the fanfare of the first democratic elections and the GNU established by Nelson Mandela.&nbsp;</p><p>Since the GNU we have no centre and confidence that there is genuine unity of purpose. It’s like an uneasy truce, while political parties catch their breath and reload weapons.&nbsp;</p><p>In the first six months of the GNU the political discourse was dominated by those commentators attacking the GNU as a sell-out and others defending as if it is a political miracle.&nbsp;</p><p>We also witnessed some of those new in government quick to latch on to inherited programmes and not only claim them as their own, but celebrate the programmes as testimony to how much better they are at governing.&nbsp;</p><p>Other newbie ministers have been zealously shutting down programmes, as their commitment to change the status quo.&nbsp;</p><p>The chattering classes have had a field day; every debate between those parties in the GNU has signalled an imminent collapse of government.&nbsp;</p><p>Those parties outside of the GNU have had the opportunity to present themselves as revolutionaries rather than this lukewarm coalition of convenience — and, of course, are ready to step into the breach if the coalition falls apart.&nbsp;</p><p>Indeed, the largest party, the ANC, celebrates the unity government as testimony to its magnanimity and putting South Africa first. Ironically, the largest of the smaller parties in the coalition, the Democratic Alliance (DA), also claims to be compromising on its principles and joining the GNU so that it can save South Africa from an ANC coalition with the Economic Freedom Fighters and the uMkhonto weSizwe party.&nbsp;</p><p>We could have a rich discussion on the supremacist attitudes of the DA, in believing that they must stop the domination of a left-wing black coalition. But that would ignore that almost 20 million people who chose not to vote — and those who did, could not choose a single party as the majority one. This is the clearest indication that South Africans may have passed a vote of no confidence in the current political parties and their leadership.&nbsp;</p><p>But you would not believe this the way South African leaders strut about in the public arena.&nbsp;</p><p>Mind you, the South African population also knows how to play the game. They fete and ululate the leaders as if they are the second coming. It looks as if the real issues are being dealt with, when most seem to be biding their time so that they get their individual opportunity.&nbsp;</p><p>The problem is not just South Africa’s alone but a global one.&nbsp;</p><p>Western democracy ceased to exist a long time ago. It was replaced by neoliberal democracy, where institutions are established for the appearance of democracy, whereas they serve the elite and wealthy.&nbsp;</p><p>Even wealthy countries with middle-class populations have little confidence in democratic institutions. People are either not voting or significant support is moving towards those that are populist and right-wing.&nbsp;</p><p>In Europe and the US, these populist parties led by people like Donald Trump or Italy’s Giorgia Meloni present themselves as the protectors of not only Western democratic values, but specifically white Christian values.&nbsp;</p><p>Trump has already won his election, so no need to focus on him. In Europe, the response to this Christian fundamentalism is to recreate the Cold War. So they make Russia and Vladimir Putin a new Hitler who wants to invade and take over Europe.&nbsp;</p><p>They do not ask why people are not voting, why public institutions are not doing what they were established to do, why people feel so helpless, why enmity and hatred between racial, gender and political groups seems to be growing.&nbsp;</p><p>Increasingly we witness people, young and old, grabbing onto anyone who seems angry enough or that opposes those in power and calling them the people’s heroes. On all sides of the political spectrum, we act as if these political battles are generation defining.&nbsp;</p><p>These matters of gender pronouns, supporting Ukraine or Russia, who stands up for Palestinians, racism and hatred and so forth may be quite vexing, but they are not the chief concerns.</p><p>Do you feel as if you are losing a sense of community?&nbsp;</p><p>Late 19th and early 20th century French sociologist Emile Durkheim called this phenomenon “anomie”. It is a feeling of loneliness and detachment from society, especially its norms.&nbsp;</p><p>Durkheim may have conceived the concept more than a century ago, but it captures how many people in South Africa and around the world are feeling.</p><p>The political party merry-go-round continues, acting as if they will tackle this despair.&nbsp;</p><p>We should not only focus on that political jamboree called the G20 Summit. Rather our focus should be the oft-talked-about national social dialogue.</p><p>Since Madiba’s time as president, we have been trying to establish a social compact between those who benefited from apartheid and those who were oppressed by it. We have failed at every attempt, and there have been many: the 1998 Presidential Jobs Summit, the 2003 Growth and Development Summit and various other interpretations, including the National Development Plan.&nbsp;</p><p>The National Economic, Development and Labour Council (Nedlac) is the common denominator whenever the government talks about a social compact. It should have been realised a while back that Nedlac cannot produce a social compact which all sectors of society will buy into.&nbsp;</p><p>It can participate in the discussions, but the institution should not be tasked with getting us there, after failing numerous times.&nbsp;</p><p>The presidency should take direct responsibility for this. But it should be more about listening to the people than bringing elites together. The government must convene small public meetings, even if it has to be ward-based, where the people are given the opportunity to say what they are experiencing, both hardship and positive outcomes, and what they think should be done. These must be face-to-face and not virtual meetings, and in those areas, everyone must get the day off from work and school to attend the meeting.</p><p>From these meetings, a regional compact must be created, and those regional compacts must be knitted together to provide us with a provincial compact, and finally, there can be a national one. Space can be created for genius ideas that may not have come from the masses of our people and the president can be given a casting vote, so as to create these as special presidential projects.&nbsp;</p><p>It is time for the people to really govern, and we have to liberate ourselves from self-serving liberal democracy political processes and our unimaginative political party leaders.</p><p><strong>Donovan E Williams is a social commentator. @TheSherpaZA on X.&nbsp;</strong></p>

ARTICLE 4 (Mail & Guardian)
Title: Building confidence builds the economy
Description: Real estate investment trusts are booming, reporting strong results for the interim period ending December
Full Content: <figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="289" height="84" src="https://mg.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Tag-AsKAsh-Muller2_page-0001.jpg" alt="Tag Askash Muller2 Page 0001" class="wp-image-659429" style="width:356px;height:auto"/></figure><p class="has-drop-cap">Real estate is an industry largely run on confidence. If people are confident about a country’s economy, its leaders and its politics, then they will invest in real estate.&nbsp;</p><p>They will build new assets. If companies are employing enough people, then developers will create new office blocks.</p><p>South Africa’s government of national unity is nearly a year old and although its members haven’t always got along well, the GNU has held together. But the national budget has had a bumpy path.&nbsp;</p><p>Several economists believe the economy will grow at close to 1% this year, while the treasury’s budget suggested we could see 1.9% growth in 2026.&nbsp;</p><p>Against the backdrop of an economy showing minor confidence, we are also in a reporting season for numerous listed property funds. These landlords are mostly real estate investment trusts (Reits), which are mandated to pay a minimum of 75% of their distributable income as a dividend each financial year. Many South African Reits typically pay 90%, if not even 100%, of their distributable income as a dividend.</p><p>A number of these Reits have June financial year-ends and released interim results for the six months to the end of December in the past couple of weeks. I found that the sentiment among these companies, including the likes of Growthpoint Properties, SA Corporate Real Estate, Hyprop Investments and Attacq, was one of positivity and optimism.</p><p>Just look at Growthpoint Properties, South Africa’s largest landlord. The company, which also has investments in Poland, Romania, the United Kingdom and Australia, delivered stronger than expected results for its six-month interim period ending December 2024. Growthpoint reported distributable income per share (DIPS) of 74 cents a share, up 3.9% from the first half of 2024, while maintaining its distribution payout ratio at 82.5%.&nbsp;</p><p>What was really pleasing is that the South African portfolio surprised on the upside.</p><p>In line with the first-half performance, Growthpoint has also upgraded its DIPS guidance for the financial year ending June 2025 from -2% to -5% negative growth to positive growth of 1% to 3%.</p><p>The company’s group chief executive, Norbert Sasse, said he expected to see continued improvement in the operational performance of South African assets, lower finance costs as interest rates fall and continued outperformance from the V&amp;A Waterfront.&nbsp;</p><p>Growthpoint owns half of the V&amp;A, South Africa’s most valuable commercial real estate investment. The other half, valued at close to R20 billion, is owned by the Public Investment Corporation. The owners know it’s the jewel in their crown and, in last September, Sasse said about R4.5 billion would be invested in this property precinct over the next two years.&nbsp;</p><p>I also recently wrote about the V&amp;A Waterfront precinct’s ambitious expansion plans. They are in the process of submitting a rezoning application to the City of Cape Town to reclaim 440 000m2.&nbsp;</p><p>Most of this will be allocated for construction in the Granger Bay precinct for mixed-use developments, including retail spaces, restaurants, hotels and residential apartments. There will be public and cultural facilities, which will involve re-establishing public access to the shoreline.</p><p>The Granger Bay precinct is in the northwest section of the V&amp;A Waterfront.</p><p>I&nbsp; also took a read of the V&amp;A Waterfront’s latest report when it comes to their December festive season numbers roundup released on 3 February 2025. Last year they had a phenomenal December period with more than three million visitors and record retail sales of almost R1.4 billion.&nbsp;</p><p>It is clear that the V&amp;A Waterfront plays a significant role in Cape Town’s tourism economy. On New Year’s Eve alone, they welcomed about 200  000 people. In total, there were more 25 million visitors, and about R10 billion was spent throughout the precinct in 2024.</p><p>Growthpoint is also active in other cities. Late last year, it announced The Olympus, a skyscraper it is building with luxury residential developer Tricolt Group. The Olympus will be a residential tower supported by retail stores in the Sandton Summit precinct, which is anchored by the Discovery head office.&nbsp;</p><p>The Tricolt Group was established in 2010 by Tim Kloeck, who was born in Nelspruit and has a Belgian background. The development company has completed more than 5  000 residences with an end value of about R16  billion.&nbsp;</p><p>Tricolt is also known for its award-winning apartment development, Ellipse Waterfall, in the heart of Waterfall City, where the most expensive penthouse in Gauteng was sold for R95  million.&nbsp;</p><p>It seems that well-established Reits in South Africa are primed to reward investors in the long run.&nbsp;</p><p>Attacq also reported strong numbers and also pushed the positive South African narrative.</p><p>Attacq is the development partner of Waterfall City, one of the country’s quickest-growing nodes, which is located in Midrand. It released financial results for the six months to end December 2024. The company’s flagship asset is Mall of Africa, the largest mall built in one phase on the African continent, with 130  000m2 of retail space. Only Fourways Shopping Centre is larger, at 178  202m2.&nbsp;</p><p>After Fourways Mall’s redevelopment in 2019, it struggled with a high level of vacancies. Recently, it has rebranded to increase foot traffic. So far, progress is optimistic. This is thanks to the mall’s newly appointed asset managers, Flanagan &amp; Gerard Property Development Group, which took over management in February 2024.</p><p>Attacq reported that its distributable income per share increased 49.1% to 55.0 cents and declared a 46.7% higher interim dividend of 44.0 cents, which is the market’s best in this reporting period.</p><p>Attacq benefits from strong partnerships, especially in Waterfall, with the likes of Sanlam, as well as the Government Employees’ Pension Fund, which recently invested more than R2 billion into the group.</p><p>“The period saw us continuing to execute against our Horizon 2030 strategy. Our efforts are reflected in our increased gross revenue and rental income achieved, improved cost-to-income ratio from 25.4% to 22.4%, and the new blue-chip clients attracted to our precincts,” said Van Niekerk.</p><p>Attacq’s chief financial officer, Raj Nana, also said the company was in a healthy place financially.</p><p>“Our strategic growth trajectory will continue into the second half, backed by our robust balance sheet, which was supported by a successful initial public auction under our domestic medium-term note programme and strategic debt refinancing undertaken during the period,” he said.</p><p>Blue-chip retail landlord Hyprop Investments, which is listed on the JSE and the secondary A2X exchange, published strong half-year results for the period ending December. It reported double-digit growth in distributable income of 14.5% to R765  million and a 14.4% increase in distributable income per share to 201.4 cents. Hyprop Investments owns top malls such as Rosebank Mall, Hyde Park Corner, Canal Walk, Cape Gate, Somerset Mall, Table Bay Mall and Clearwater Mall.</p><p>In a statement, the group declared an interim dividend of 113.43 cents a share, which equates to 95% of the distributable income from the South African portfolio for the 2025 financial half-year results.</p><p>The company is aiming to sell some Gauteng assets and invest more in Cape Town. I’m told Hyde Park Corner and The Glen are up for sale.</p><p>SA Corporate Real Estate, a diversified fund, increased its distribution to 24.37 cents a share for the year ending 31  December, up from 23.18 cents a share the previous year. Its distributable income increased 5.1% to R680.9  million, or 27.08 cents a share. Total net property income (NPI) was R1.5  billion, up from R1.3  billion the previous year. Total like-for-like NPI increased 6.7% to R1.1  billion. These are all strong numbers.&nbsp;</p><p>Through its holding in AFHCO, the company owns numerous residential, neighbourhood retail and industrial assets. It recently acquired the formerly listed Indluplace Properties, a residential landlord. According to the AFHCO website, it is the leading property company of affordable apartments and retail spaces in Johannesburg and intends to spread throughout the greater Johannesburg area.</p><p>SA Corporate Real Estate’s chief executive, Rory Mackey, expressed positive sentiment last week.</p><p>Hopefully the banks will note these positive results and fund more projects as our economy (slowly but surely) gets going.</p><p><strong>Ask Ash examines South Africa’s property, architecture and living spaces.
