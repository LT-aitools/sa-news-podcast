Title: ANC and DA contemplate end of days
Description: Both parties are mindful of the magnitude of a split as South Africa faces more economic turmoil

Full Content: 
<p class="has-drop-cap">On the morning after the <a href="https://mg.co.za/politics/2025-04-02-budget-scrapes-through-the-national-assembly-after-da-revolt/">budget battle</a>, neither the ANC nor the Democratic Alliance (DA) appeared readily able to find the will or a way to salvage the grand coalition they formed 10  months ago.</p>



<p>President Cyril Ramaphosa was contemplating the future of the government without the ANC’s biggest partner, while DA leaders were weighing the case for and against withdrawing from the post-election pact.</p>



<p>The party’s ranks were expecting a final announcement at the weekend, while some of the ANC’s staunchest proponents of working with the former opposition said they believed this was the end of the arrangement.</p>



<p>“What alternative is there after the events of the past days?” one asked.</p>



<p>Ramaphosa’s insistence on building that partnership into a broader, government of national unity (GNU) was always short-term insurance against a standoff such as the one that ensued over Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana’s unpopular VAT increase.</p>



<p>The DA’s refusal to back the first budget Godongwana prepared for tabling in February with a two percentage point increase did not sink the coalition because senior ANC ministers also did not support the hike. The ANC did not waste time hurling recriminations over the prior leaking of budget proposals because it did not believe the DA alone was to blame, such was the unease about the increase.</p>



<p>And there was a readiness to concede, at least among Ramaphosa’s closer allies in the party, that the time had come to make the budget process more transparent and consultative.</p>



<p>But senior ANC government officials view the DA’s revolt against the coalition line on Wednesday to vote against the reworked fiscal framework Godongwana tabled on 12  March as the final straw in a relationship that never settled into a one of reliable cooperation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ramaphosa’s office summed up the state of play, moments after the National Assembly voted by 194 to 182 to approve the measure, by warning that it was not possible to be part of the government but reject the budget.&nbsp;</p>



<p>His spokesperson Vincent Magwenya said it was hard to see how six DA cabinet ministers could implement a fiscal framework they had sought to block.</p>



<p>He added a reminder that Ramaphosa never took rushed decisions. The president had, in leaked <a href="https://mg.co.za/politics/2025-04-02-ramaphosa-wants-the-da-to-remain-in-the-coalition/">remarks to the ANC caucus</a> on the eve of the vote, reminded colleagues of his preference to allow opponents plenty of rope to hang themselves.</p>



<p>A DA strategist said the party would not act in “a rushed or rash fashion either”.</p>



<p>The decision is not made any easier for either by the country faces more economic trouble after US President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced he was imposing a 10% tariff on all imports to the US and additional <a href="https://mg.co.za/news/2025-04-03-trump-announces-30-reciprocal-tariffs-for-south-africa/">reciprocal tariffs</a> for dozens of countries, including 30% for South Africa.</p>



<p>The stability of the GNU has been a selling point for cabinet ministers trying to encourage foreign investment and find new trade partners after Trump declared diplomatic war on South Africa in February, signalling that exclusion from preferential trade under the African Growth and Opportunity Act would follow.</p>



<p>But the parties have lived at loggerheads over economic and foreign policy, aside from the wrangle over key health and land legislation, and the DA’s frustration was that the ANC refused to share power and let it influence policy where it mattered.</p>



<p>It recently took a decision to stop referring to these battles as red lines because, as one MP put it privately, “that has not worked out well for us a number of times now”.</p>



<p>The VAT increase in itself was not a real red line, as the DA had in negotiations agreed to accept the hike in return for an agreement that the ANC would agree to spending reforms and allowing the party to help shape the country’s economic agenda.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It added further demands to the list in negotiations that stretched from last week to Tuesday’s meeting of parliament’s standing and select finance committees where, with the help of ActionSA, the ANC fudged a way out of the impasse.</p>



<p>These included that the deputy finance minister, Ashor Sarupen, be named as co-chair of Operation Vulindlela, the unit in the presidency that drives structural reforms, alongside his fellow deputy finance minister, David Masondo, as well as an amendment to the Expropriation Act.</p>



<p>The DA is challenging the law in court, as it will now do with the fiscal framework.</p>



<p>“At what stage will the DA realise it has to govern with us, not against us?” asked one ANC member of government, who added that after the events of this week there was no alternative to the party’s exit from the coalition.</p>



<p>“Former president Thabo Mbeki always urges leaders to deal with concrete reality when exercising their duties of leadership and to avoid dealing with an imagined reality. The DA is incapable of that.”</p>



<p>The ANC does not blame DA leader John Steenhuisen for the party’s hard line and believes he probably lost an internal battle “with people who found the GNU incompatible with their beliefs and agenda”.</p>



<p>That is code-speak for Helen Zille, the party’s federal chairperson, whom the ANC has, since the coalition negotiations last year, cast as the hardliner driving DA decision-making.</p>



<p>The reality is more nuanced but an influential DA member said on Thursday he believed that if Ramaphosa were to seek to repair the relationship by offering the DA some of the substantive policy concessions it had sought in return for supporting the fiscal framework, Steenhuisen would be amenable to staying in the coalition.</p>



<p>The real question, he said, was whither the economy, because it would determine how voters, and donors, judged its participation in the GNU.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The red lines all run along economic reservations,” the source said, adding that the DA’s foreign policy concerns spoke to the country’s economic fortunes.</p>



<p>“Our objective was to get the economy growing. Now, if we are not able to do so, if the ANC’s understanding of the GNU is a continuation of policies that were followed before, then it becomes really difficult either to achieve that change or to benefit politically from the decline of the ANC.”</p>



<p>He likened remaining in the coalition under present conditions to being a passenger on a sinking ship, and commanding the ministries of agriculture, basic education, communications, environment, home affairs and public works as “moving the deck chairs on the Titanic”.</p>



<p>There is considerable scepticism in the DA that the promise of concessions that came from Ramaphosa’s office to its negotiators were sincere. The suspicion of bad faith was inevitable because the ANC was also negotiating with the Economic Freedom Fighters and eventually ActionSA.</p>



<p>The latter, which is outside the coalition and holds six seats in the National Assembly, came through at little political cost by tabling a proposal to the finance committees to approve the fiscal framework, but add a recommendation that Godongwana find an alternative to the VAT increase and fiscal creep in the next 30 days.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The compromise is not unlawful, as some MPs protested, but neither is it binding, and the committee report and subsequent vote paved the way for the tax increases to take effect on 1  May. There is too little time, even if there was the will, to undo the operation of section 7(4) of the VAT Act in respect of the fiscal framework.</p>



<p>“Maybe the president can backtrack and say there is space for compromise. If that is possible, it is certainly in the country’s interest to try and if it depends on the DA and it depends on John Steenhuisen, he would certainly be happy to try,” the DA member said.</p>



<p>DA founder Tony Leon noted that the agreement always rested on an understanding that “the DA would share power, not all power, but some power, in determining the economic weather of the country”.</p>



<p>He said the party, which has highly reliable in-house polling, would be weighing voter sentiment but also, again, whether it could forge a working relationship with the ANC that, although far from ideal, allowed it to conclude that staying in the government, and keeping out worse alternative ANC partners, was in the country’s interest.</p>



<p>“You will get a mixed picture. Some people will say leave immediately and others will say hang in at any price. These are imperfect choices that have to be made within not an inordinate amount of time as a whole range of crises descend on the country, some provoked by the ANC, some not of their choosing.”</p>



<p>Ramaphosa is mindful of the economic risk of letting the DA leave the coalition, but also faces pressure in his own party to call time on the arrangement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Leon suggested the president should consider whether he wanted to spend the remainder of his term not knowing whether the ANC can muster the necessary numbers on any key vote, noting that, had all uMkhonto weSizwe’s MPs made it to the house on Wednesday, the fiscal framework would not have been approved.</p>



<p>“Jean-Paul Sartre said: ‘If a victory is told in detail, one can no longer distinguish it from a defeat,’ he said, referring to the French philosopher.</p>



<p>“So the ANC has to say to itself: is this how we are going to govern the country, going from vote to vote uncertain whether we will get a ‘yes’ vote in parliament on anything from a motion of no confidence to future budgets and legislation, or do we want a stable coalition with reliable partners?&nbsp;</p>



<p>“If the answer is the latter, they have to look at what kind of partnership it is.”</p>

Title: Nakhane is a lot of things — but not a pop star
Description: The acclaimed multimedia artist Nakhane continues to explore the themes that have made them a rare talent across many creative fields
Full Content: 
<p>This week, Nakhane launched the music video for Killer 25, his bold rendition of the classic Adamski and Seal song first released in 1990.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the song was introduced under Adamski’s name, Seal’s distinctive vocals and introspective lyrics helped make it a defining anthem for the early Nineties British rave and house scene.</p>



<p>Touching on themes of breaking free from societal constraints, personal struggles and the need for authenticity, Killer contains ideas that have resonated with listeners across different generations, geographies and backgrounds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The famous line “It’s the loneliness that’s the killer” speaks to the isolation and emotional disconnection relatable to many.</p>



<p>Its success led to the launch of Seal’s solo career. He later re-recorded Killer for his 1991 debut album but it was George Michael’s 1993 cover of the song that first inspired the young Nakhane.</p>



<p>“I’m so happy it’s finally out&nbsp; because, just on my phone, I have 36 versions of the song,” Nakhane says during a Zoom call, speaking from London, their home of seven years.</p>



<p>The title is a nod to Michael, who named his 1990-released hit song Freedom 90. In this way, Nakhane’s version of Killer honours Michael, along with Adamski and Seal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The release has been a long time coming, as Nakhane has been performing their version of the song for six years, but it was only last year that they began to work in earnest on a recorded version.</p>



<p>So, why now?</p>



<p>“The fact that I finished it,” says Nakhane. “I mean, that’s a joke, but I’m also being dead serious.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“In my younger years, I used to believe that I had to write a song and finish it the moment that I got the inspiration for it. But then, with my last album, I allowed myself to write a verse and then leave it, then come back to it the next day and write a chorus — to take my time.</p>



<p>“Also, because with that album I chose to be a co-producer on every song, I realised that this was something that I had been doing anyway, but wasn’t being credited for.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“So, while I was writing, I was also producing, and that takes time. But Killer 25 was the first song that I felt, like, ‘Okay, let me stick my neck out here and be a producer,’ you know?&nbsp;</p>



<p>“And that’s something that I’ve been really enjoying and learning a lot from along the way.”</p>



<p>Nakhane has been a captivating figure in South African music for over a decade, dating back to the 2013 release of their first album Brave Confusion. Since then they’ve released two more — You Will Not Die and Bastard Jargon — but they’ve also done much more, branching into acting, writing and film-making.</p>



<p>From their 2015 debut as an author with the novel Piggy Boy Blues to their first film role in the 2017 drama Inxeba (The Wound), to last year’s appearance in the theatrical production The Seeker in London, Nakhane has bravely explored multiple areas of creative expression.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1000" height="750" src="https://mg.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1-1000x750.jpeg" alt="1" class="wp-image-669976" srcset="https://mg.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1-1000x750.jpeg 1000w, https://mg.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1-400x300.jpeg 400w, https://mg.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://mg.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, https://mg.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1-600x450.jpeg 600w, https://mg.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1.jpeg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure>



<p>One of the biggest moments of their early career was when they featured on the Black Coffee hit We Dance Again, which became a massive hit locally and internationally. But during our conversation, Nakhane brings it up as one of many moments when people tried to put them in a box.</p>



<p>“When that song came out, everyone assumed that I would just make house music now,” they say.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“And I was, like, ‘No, I’m going to make whatever I’m inspired to make.’ God knows what that is. But I follow the muse and some people don’t necessarily like where the muse is telling me to go.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“But then the thing I create is there forever, hopefully, and whoever is going to discover it in 10, 20, 30 years’ time, it’s there for them.”</p>



<p>In the past few years, the muse has told Nakhane to go in the direction of film-making and the result is his directorial debut, B(l)ind the Sacrifice, an evocative short film that explores the themes of religious tension and social isolation that have been so influential to their music.</p>



<p>It has received critical acclaim and premiered at several international festivals, including the Locarno Film Festival in Switzerland, the Stockholm Film Festival in Sweden and, most recently, the Sundance Film Festival in the US.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During our interview, Nakhane is tight-lipped on the date but says that B(l)ind the Sacrifice will make its homecoming to SA this year.</p>



<p>Nakhane also composed the music for the film and they’re not slowing down their output anytime soon. They tell me they’re planning to release more singles this year and are working on two albums, a novel and two feature films.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Foregoing the endless slashes that would need to be included in their title if they listed all their creative roles, Nakhane simply calls themselves a multimedia artist: “I call myself a multimedia artist because that could be anything,” they explain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The public’s very eager to put artists in a box. And by calling myself a multimedia artist, it means they can’t because I said I was playing in different media from the beginning. So, if I come out saying I’m a painter tomorrow, no one will go, ‘Since when?’ Multimedia is infinite. That can be anything.”</p>



<p>One title Nakhane wants nothing to do with is that of pop star. In fact, they describe trying to be one as the biggest failure of their career.</p>



<p>“I listened to bad advice and tried to play a pop star role but it just didn’t fit,” they say. “It was just a step back. So, quite quickly, I was, like, ‘I’m not good at this. And why am I doing this?’ None of this feels good. And it’s not working, you know?&nbsp;</p>



<p>“And I feel like the people who love me and know me could see that it didn’t work but the people who wanted to make money from my music kept telling me it was right.</p>



<p>‘I didn’t like the cultivating of a personality, the shaving off of the rough edges and the making everything easier to consume. And that made me reconsider.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I was, like, ‘Whoa, okay, what lesson are we learning here?’ And I think I learned the lesson that you don’t just wake up and become a pop star. It’s work and it’s worked at. I just don’t have the disposition for it.”</p>



<p>One aspect of being a pop star that made Nakhane uncomfortable was the idea of trying to be universal, a concept they reject outright.</p>



<p>“I hate that word because in this world ‘universal’ usually means proximity to whiteness,” they say.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Whenever I hear someone say, ‘Ah, this is universal,’ it normally means it’s accepted from a Western perspective because no one says that Miriam Makeba is universal or that Chinua Achebe is universal. But everyone says William Shakespeare and F Scott Fitzgerald are universal.”</p>



<p>“Baba Zakes Mda doesn’t get to be universal. He’s so provincial, right? I think that’s exactly what I want to be. That specificity and provinciality are so important.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“A lot of the good Western writers were incredibly provincial and specific. James Joyce is so specific, so provincial, so Irish, you know, so Dublin. You have to put yourself in that world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“So if I, as a black South African from Alice in the rural areas, can put myself in that world and understand it and understand those characters, why is it so difficult for the opposite?”</p>



<p>“Actually, specificity and provinciality are the only things I can say are universal because then you go, ‘Oh, wow, we’re not so different after all.’ Yeah, sure, there are certain cultural things that are not the same as mine but human beings are human beings, no matter where in the world you find them.”</p>



<p>Perhaps that’s the thread that runs through all Nakhane’s creative endeavours — the specificity of being a queer black boy who grew up in a small rural town in the Eastern Cape and had to overcome a barrage of resistance for the right simply to be who they were always born to be.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Their artistic fingerprint is a kind of fearless self-possession that makes you want to joyously embrace your identity, in all its contradictions, even if demanding the space to do so is sometimes painful. It’s for this reason Nakhane’s art, in all the different forms it takes, is a blessing.</p>

Title: Who benefits from the budget war?
Description: This is a moment that calls for strong leaders and a united nation. Right now, we don’t have either
Full Content: 
<p class="has-drop-cap">As we piece together the fallout from a chaotic week, we have to ask ourselves — who benefits?</p>



<p>There is a perverse irony in the answer.</p>



<p>The budget war has been fought in the name of the South African people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Democratic Alliance’s (DA) original casus belli was the assault on consumers that a substantial VAT increase would have been.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Parties have since been wrangling over what would benefit the country and those living in it.</p>



<p>With the government of national unity (GNU) at breaking point, and uncertainty about the country’s future, it’s clear that no one benefits — least of all the South African people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are once more the victims of self-motivated political actors. The failure of the GNU would be an indictment of everyone in it.</p>



<p>At its inception, we dedicated much editorial space to celebrating the rare maturity rushing through the halls of power.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For the first time in recent memory, there was a palpable sense that the government was functioning as intended and in service of those who elected it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We all felt a cautious tingling of optimism — a feeling that had become foreign to us during the lost Zuma years and the tepid first term of his successor.</p>



<p>That enthusiasm has been well and truly stomped out. We have seen a return to the zero-sum-game politics that have plagued us for so long: an environment where chicanery flourishes and cooperation is secondary.</p>



<p>To finger-point here would only further perpetuate this game, but suffice to say that no one can hold up their head in pride, from the DA, which declared victory after the aborted budget in February, to the ANC, which would rather return to backroom dealing than work with its partners.</p>



<p>And even us, the electorate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The GNU is a product of our design. Voter turnout is tumbling. Unless we find a way to mobilise as a society and reverse this apathetic trend, how long is it until South Africa’s elected governments are no longer legitimate?</p>



<p>Our present debacle could not happen at a worse time. We are in the crosshairs of the most powerful man on earth. At the time of writing, we are still contemplating the devastating effects that his new tariff hike will have.</p>



<p>This is a moment that calls for strong leaders and a united nation. Right now, we don’t have either.</p>

Title: New geopolitical blockbusters out in 2025
Description: Global audiences will be kept on the edge of their seats as the old scripts get ripped up and key actors must adapt to new screenplays
Full Content: 
<p class="has-drop-cap">For 80 years, from the end of World War II to 19 January 2025, there was one geopolitical blockbuster playing in every cinema. </p>



<p>The actors came and went, but they all knew their lines and stuck to the script, even when they improvised. Now, with several movies playing at the same time, leaders must manage complexity and uncertainty simultaneously.</p>



<p>For decades, the geopolitical stage was dominated by a single script — globalised institutions supported by American leadership. This script revolved around Western-style democracy, free markets and free trade, and aiming for peace and wealth through coordinated global interventions to deal with problems, from rising powers to regional conflicts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But, as we get into 2025, the well-worn script has given way to a multiplex of competing narratives.</p>



<p>One of the most gripping features in this geopolitical multiplex is The China Syndrome. China has transitioned from mere competitor to a strategic adversary of the US in many respects.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The US is still the leading economic power with a GDP about $10 trillion bigger than that of China but Chinese influence is growing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>China boasts the largest standing army and advanced technologies like hypersonic missiles and cyber capabilities but America, with about 1.3 million soldiers, is still generally rated first for military power.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The confrontation spans multiple domains: technology, space, economics and alliances. The US response includes strategic realignments with allies including Japan and India, while fortifying its presence in critical areas like Taiwan and the Indian Ocean.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This movie is not just about rivalry; it’s about redefining global norms.</p>



<p>Another feature playing out is Wall Street, which focuses on America’s internal recalibration to improve competitiveness. </p>



<p>Focused on energy dominance, smaller government, deregulation and re-industrialisation through tariffs and technology protection, this story is about economic sovereignty as statecraft.&nbsp;Artificial intelligence, energy dominance and re-industrialisation are key themes in this plotline.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Middle East remains a hotspot with overlapping narratives captured in a double feature titled Tehran &amp; Black Hawk Down. Iran is seen as the root of extremism in the region, while Israel transforms from an ally to a strategic partner for the US.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This storyline forces regional players like Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan to make tough choices amid growing instability in Syria, Yemen and Sudan.&nbsp;The chain reaction of conflicts threatens not just regional security but also global energy supplies — a subplot that keeps audiences on edge.</p>



<p>Europe faces its own cinematic drama in Hunt for Red October. The Ukrainian conflict has become a European problem demanding collective responsibility. Russia emerges as both an adversary and a potential ally in countering China’s dominance.&nbsp;Europe and the UK must recalibrate their economy, defence policies and energy strategies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This narrative underscores the struggle for Europe to assert itself on a fragmented global stage.</p>



<p>Africa enters the geopolitical multiplex with Out of Africa, where Muslim extremism and Chinese influence are key antagonists. The US, China and Europe are all cutting aid while vying for strategic minerals, geographic assets and energy investments.&nbsp;Initiatives like the Lobito Corridor Railway line aim to boost transport infrastructure for African allies.</p>



<p>But Africa faces tough choices between Western-leaning policies or aligning with China — a dilemma that could shape its future trajectory.</p>



<p>In The Gods Must Be Crazy, South Africa grapples with existential questions about governance models — free markets versus state control — and alliances with Western powers or China.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Corruption versus rule of law and affordable energy access remain recurring themes in navigating opportunities in energy and agriculture.&nbsp;The consequences of poor choices could lead to isolation or collapse under sanctions and restricted access to global financial systems.</p>



<p>Don’t forget Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, where the land of Vulgaria banned children.&nbsp; As before 1914, demographics influence decision-making. </p>



<p>China&#8217;s population could shrink from its current 1.4 billion to about 525 million by 2100, a reduction of more than 60%. Russia’s could drop by almost as much. No wonder they think that military adventurism has to happen now or never.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Across Asia, women seem to be losing interest in not just children but marriage, compounding the state-induced gender imbalance. Fertility rates in North Africa and parts of West Asia have also plunged.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By contrast, more than half the babies born globally in 2100 will be African, mostly West African. Imagine a future where Europe and East Asia compete desperately for Nigerian and Malian immigrants to sustain their ageing societies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What makes today’s geopolitical landscape so challenging is not just the number of narratives but their interconnectedness. Leaders must navigate overlapping conflicts while balancing economic priorities and military strategies. </p>



<p>For instance, the US’s focus on trade and re-industrialisation cannot be divorced from its rivalry with China. These decisions ripple across global trade networks, policy choices and political alliances.</p>



<p>With the old script shredded, improvisation is essential. Leaders must embrace complexity, become creative and seek opportunities for innovation in uncertainty. As audiences worldwide watch these stories unfold, one thing is clear — managing complexity will be the defining skill of global leadership beyond 2025.</p>

Title: Not on our watch: DA moves to block VAT hike through legal action
Description: In its court papers filed on Thursday, the party said the fiscal framework that will lead to the tax increase was pushed through unprocedurally

Full Content: 
<p class="has-drop-cap">The <a href="https://mg.co.za/tag/democratic-alliance/">Democratic Alliance </a>(DA) on Thursday filed an urgent court application at the Western Cape high court against what it said were procedural and constitutional irregularities in approving a fiscal framework that will probably see an increase in VAT.</p>



<p>The party has also accused the ANC of not negotiating in good faith within the government of national unity (GNU), warning that the VAT hike would exacerbate the country’s cost of living crisis.</p>



<p>Speaking outside the court, DA federal council chairperson<a href="https://mg.co.za/tag/helen-zille/"> Helen Zille</a> and finance spokesperson <a href="https://mg.co.za/tag/mark-burke/">Mark Burke</a> detailed the party’s bid to interdict the staggered VAT increase proposed by Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana, which would see the first 0.5 percentage point hike take effect on 1 May.</p>



<p>The court filing comes a day after the National Assembly <a href="https://mg.co.za/politics/2025-04-02-budget-scrapes-through-the-national-assembly-after-da-revolt/">voted by a narrow margin</a> on Wednesday to pass the fiscal framework, despite the DA’s refusal to support it.</p>



<p>In the debate preceding the vote, Burke argued that a recommendation by parliament’s finance committee that Godongwana use the next 30 days to find an alternative to the VAT increase was not worth the paper it was written on.</p>



<p>The ANC secured the budget&#8217;s approval with support from ActionSA, Build One South Africa, the Patriotic Alliance, Inkatha Freedom Party, United Democratic Movement and other minority parties. The DA, Freedom Front Plus, Economic Freedom Fighters and Jacob Zuma’s uMkhonto weSizwe party voted against it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The DA’s legal case consists of two key elements. The first challenges the process followed by parliament’s committees on finance, which the party says was unprocedural and therefore invalidates the adoption of the fiscal framework.</p>



<p>The second seeks to declare section 7(4) of the Value Added Tax Act unconstitutional, arguing that it improperly grants the finance minister the authority to impose tax increases without full parliamentary approval.</p>



<p>“The DA never only has one plan. We are absolutely determined to stop the VAT hike and we believe this case will expose how the ANC is trying to bypass democratic processes,” Zille said.</p>



<p>The party also criticised ActionSA, which helped secure the ANC commitment to not implement the VAT hike. Zille dismissed this assertion as “delusional”, arguing that the fiscal framework adopted in parliament includes the VAT increase and cannot be undone without proper legislative action.</p>



<p>“We are not in the GNU for blue lights or cars or ministerial homes or status. We are in that GNU for one sole purpose and that is to get South Africa&#8217;s economy to grow at the rate it needs to grow in order to absorb more people into productive employment and thereby reduce poverty. That is why we are here,” she said.</p>



<p>“We are not going to play any games that enable the ANC to retain its profligate spending, its extreme wastage — not even do a spending review of, for example, ghost employees in the system, but just continue taxing South Africans till they cannot even put food on the table. So our plan B is to take this to court.”</p>



<p>The DA’s legal challenge comes amid growing tension in the GNU, with the party accusing the ANC of failing to honour coalition commitments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zille said the DA had proposed a comprehensive economic reform package to stimulate job creation and investment but that smaller parties within the coalition government had ultimately sided with the ANC to push through the <a href="https://mg.co.za/politics/2025-03-07-budget-impasse-down-to-the-wire/">fiscal framework</a> without necessary conditions met.</p>



<p>Asked whether the legal challenge signals the DA’s intention to leave the government of national unity, Zille said the party’s federal executive would meet to assess its options. But she insisted that the DA would not support any budget that puts additional financial strain on South Africans.</p>



<p>On Tuesday night, President Cyril Ramaphosa told the ANC caucus that the DA would, by implication, be leading itself out of the partnership if it failed to vote for the fiscal and revenue proposals. His remarks were recorded without his knowledge and leaked.</p>



<p>On Wednesday, ahead of the budget vote, <a href="https://mg.co.za/politics/2025-04-02-budget-scrapes-through-the-national-assembly-after-da-revolt/">Ramaphosa’s office said</a> the president was committed to the GNU, appreciated the work of DA cabinet ministers and preferred for the party to remain part of the coalition, but the budget was a test of its commitment to that pact.</p>



<p>“The president remains committed to keeping the GNU together and, in fact, with the DA’s continued participation,” Ramaphosa’s spokesperson Vincent Magwenya said.</p>



<p>“What the DA does during the budget vote today will determine its own commitment, not only to the GNU, but to the people of South Africa.”</p>

Title: Puppets, prose and perseverance: JM Coetzee’s Life & Times of Michael K comes to life
Description: The author’s classic is reimagined through puppetry in a powerful stage adaptation

Full Content: 
<p class="has-drop-cap">The John Kani Theatre at the Market Theatre in Johannesburg is buzzing with excitement as the opening night of Life &amp; Times of Michael K unfolds before an eager audience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The theatre, named after one of South Africa’s most iconic actors and playwrights, feels like a tribute to the legacy of the arts in South Africa.</p>



<p>But I’m a bit frustrated. I had hoped to grab a quick bite to eat before the show, opting instead for a light snack on my way here.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I had planned to indulge in Market Theatre popcorn — a treat I always look forward to. Imagine my surprise and mild disappointment at being&nbsp; told that they’ve run out. I should have made that snack a bit heartier.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, as the curtain rises, my little grievance fades away. For tonight is about much more than popcorn. It’s about one of South Africa’s literary giants — JM Coetzee — and the captivating artistry of puppeteering.</p>



<p>JM Coetzee is one of those names every South African who cares about literature has come across. He’s the type of writer whose work will inevitably come up in any conversation about the most important contemporary voices in world literature.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Coetzee’s influence is monumental, and his words resonate not only in the literary community but also in the broader cultural conversation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The themes he grapples with —colonialism, power, identity — are both vast and deeply personal, addressing the intricate complexities of human existence.</p>



<p>Born in Cape Town, Coetzee has established a global literary presence with works that explore the uncomfortable realities of the relationship between the coloniser and the colonised. His writing is often dark, profound and unapologetically honest.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As Alexander Parker writes in the book 50 Flippen Brilliant South Africans, “The themes of Coetzee’s writing, as with any great author, are vast, complex and the subject of numerous post-doctoral theses and literary essays.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>From Disgrace to Waiting for the Barbarians, Coetzee’s body of work has become essential reading for anyone interested in the intersection of history, politics and the human psyche.</p>



<p>It’s no surprise, then, that Life &amp; Times of Michael K, one of Coetzee’s most haunting works, is being brought to life on stage at the Market.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1000" height="811" src="https://mg.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/BillyEdwardsAndrewBucklandFaniswaYisaSandraPrinslooCraigLeoNolufefeNtshuntshe-1000x811.jpg" alt="Billyedwards,andrewbuckland,faniswayisa,sandraprinsloo,craigleo,nolufefentshuntshe" class="wp-image-669886" srcset="https://mg.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/BillyEdwardsAndrewBucklandFaniswaYisaSandraPrinslooCraigLeoNolufefeNtshuntshe-1000x811.jpg 1000w, https://mg.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/BillyEdwardsAndrewBucklandFaniswaYisaSandraPrinslooCraigLeoNolufefeNtshuntshe-400x324.jpg 400w, https://mg.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/BillyEdwardsAndrewBucklandFaniswaYisaSandraPrinslooCraigLeoNolufefeNtshuntshe-768x623.jpg 768w, https://mg.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/BillyEdwardsAndrewBucklandFaniswaYisaSandraPrinslooCraigLeoNolufefeNtshuntshe-600x486.jpg 600w, https://mg.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/BillyEdwardsAndrewBucklandFaniswaYisaSandraPrinslooCraigLeoNolufefeNtshuntshe.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure>



<p>The cast consists of Sandra Prinsloo, Andrew Buckland, Faniswa Yisa, puppet master Craig Leo, Roshina Ratnam, Carlo Daniels, Billy Langa, Markus Schabbing, Nolufefe Ntshuntshe and Nkosinathi Mngomezulu. Susan Danford will replace Sandra Prinsloo for the last week of the run.</p>



<p>The story follows Michael K, a man whose life is marked by suffering, isolation and a relentless desire to fulfil his mother’s dying wish — to return to the farm she was born on. It is a story of survival, of navigating a world that is hostile to difference.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And as I sit in the audience, watching it unfold, I am reminded of the harsh realities of Coetzee’s world — a world where survival itself can feel like a political act.</p>



<p>I have to admit, I’m not usually a fan of puppets. The idea of a puppet show has never appealed to me.&nbsp;</p>



<p>My earliest memory of a puppet show dates back to my primary school days when a troupe came to perform for us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I remember paying R1.50 to watch the show, only to sleep through the entire thing. I was punished by having to sit in the principal’s office and write an essay explaining why I had slept through the performance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Frankly, I wasn’t upset by the punishment — I would have preferred to write an essay than sit through another puppet show.</p>



<p>But tonight, all that changes.</p>



<p>The puppet performance of Life &amp; Times of Michael K is unlike anything I have experienced before.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From the moment the show begins, I am struck by how real the Michael K puppet feels. It is not simply an object moved by strings or rods; it is a living, breathing entity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is impossible not to feel that the puppet and its puppeteer are one.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Leo, the puppeteer, brings Michael K to life with such precision and empathy that the puppet no longer feels like a mere representation — it feels like a real person. I find myself sitting up straighter, my attention fully captivated.</p>



<p>The connection between Leo and Michael K is palpable. It’s as though Leo has studied every nuance of the puppet’s movements, anticipating its every gesture and emotion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is no separation between Leo and the puppet; they move as one. Every subtle shift in Michael K’s posture, every tilt of the head, every gesture is an intimate moment shared between the two.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And although the audience can clearly see the puppet master at work, there is an overwhelming sense that Michael K is alive, that he is real.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="667" src="https://mg.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/LifeandTimesofMichaelK-1-1000x667.jpg" alt="Lifeandtimesofmichaelk (1)" class="wp-image-669888" srcset="https://mg.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/LifeandTimesofMichaelK-1-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://mg.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/LifeandTimesofMichaelK-1-400x267.jpg 400w, https://mg.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/LifeandTimesofMichaelK-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://mg.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/LifeandTimesofMichaelK-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://mg.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/LifeandTimesofMichaelK-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mg.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/LifeandTimesofMichaelK-1.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure>



<p>At that moment, it hits me — puppeteering is an art form that requires an incredible amount of skill, patience and empathy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is not just about moving a figure, it is about breathing life into something inanimate. In the world of puppetry, the puppet becomes an extension of the puppeteer, a vessel for expression, a conduit for storytelling.</p>



<p>The beauty of puppeteering lies in its ability to create a profound emotional connection between the audience and the story.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is no need for flashy special effects or elaborate set designs. The puppet itself, with the help of a talented puppeteer, can tell a story that resonates on a deeply human level.</p>



<p>The life of Michael K, as depicted in Coetzee’s novel and this stage adaptation, is a heartbreaking one.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Born with a physical deformity, a cleft lip, Michael K is immediately set apart from what society deems “normal.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>His mother is a domestic worker, and Michael K grows up in the shadow of poverty, struggling to survive in a world that offers him no opportunities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite his challenges, Michael K remains steadfast in his commitment to his mother, fulfilling her dying wish to return to the farm where she was born.</p>



<p>The story is heavy with themes of isolation, the failure of institutions and the futility of trying to achieve something meaningful in a world that seems intent on breaking you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yet, through it all, Michael K never gives up on his goal. His determination to carry his mother’s ashes to Prince Albert, despite the obstacles he faces, is nothing short of heroic.</p>



<p>There is something deeply inspiring about Michael K’s resilience. His life is a series of setbacks and struggles, but through it all, he persists.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In many ways, Michael K is the archetype of the everyman — the person who never seems to catch a break, yet who refuses to give up, no matter how difficult the journey.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are so many Michael Ks in the world, people whose lives are filled with hardship, yet whose strength and determination carry them forward.</p>



<p>Life &amp; Times of Michael K is a work of profound emotional depth, brought to life by the genius of Coetzee and the artistry of Leo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The fusion of literature and puppetry creates an experience that is both moving and thought-provoking.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Through the lens of Michael K’s life, we are reminded of the resilience of the human spirit, the unwavering pursuit of a goal and the power of art to transcend the limitations of the physical world.</p>



<p>As I leave the theatre, I realise that perhaps I have been missing something in my previous encounters with puppetry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is not simply a child’s pastime or an old-fashioned form of entertainment; it is an art that requires skill, precision and deep emotional intelligence.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And just like the life of Michael K, it reminds us that, even in the face of overwhelming adversity, we can still find meaning, connection and hope.</p>



<p>Life &amp; Times of Michael K runs until 13 April at the Market Theatre in Johannesburg.</p>

Title: Denials of police torture dominate week five of Joslin Smith kidnapping trial
Description: A female sergeant has been accused of taking part in the alleged torture of accused two, but senior officers denied any knowledge or involvement

Full Content: 
<p class="has-drop-cap">Two senior Western Cape police officers found themselves on the defensive this week, distancing their departments from allegations that suspects in the Joslin Smith kidnapping and trafficking trial were violently coerced into making confessions.</p>



<p>The officers — and their subordinates — denied any role in what defence lawyers say were acts of torture that led to false confessions by two of the three accused.</p>



<p>&nbsp;Brigadier Leon Hanana, head of the province’s Serious and Violent Crimes Unit, testified in the Western Cape high court, sitting in Saldanha Bay, that he had neither witnessed nor sanctioned any physical abuse during the interrogations of Jacquen “Boeta” Appollis and Steveno van Rhyn, accused one and two in the high-profile case.</p>



<p>Both men have claimed they were tortured during lengthy overnight questioning in early March 2024.</p>



<p>&nbsp;“I was not part of the operational interviews,” Hanana told the court under cross-examination. “If anything like that had happened in front of me, I would have acted — either through disciplinary action or criminal charges.”</p>



<p>The courtroom exchange unfolded during a trial-within-a-trial to determine whether the men’s confessions were admissible in court.</p>



<p>Defence lawyers argued that the alleged abuse from 4 March and the early hours of 5 March amounted to torture, after which both men made their false confessions. They also contend neither Appollis or Van Rhyn were read their rights.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Van Rhyn’s attorney, Nobahle Mkabayi, said her client was unknowingly picked up by undercover officers and taken to a remote beach where the abuse began, before being transferred to the Sea Border offices, where it allegedly continued until 2am or 3am on 5 March.</p>



<p>“Did you hear screams that night?” Mkabayi asked Hanana, who claimed he was in a different office at the time of the interview.</p>



<p>“No, I did not hear any screams,” he replied.</p>



<p>When asked whether the interview had taken place on his instruction, Hanana deflected: “My role was strategic, not operational. The lead investigator was responsible for interviews.”</p>



<p>That lead investigator is Captain Wesley Lombard, a 22-year veteran of the province’s Organised Crime Unit and a member of the anti-kidnapping task team, who reports to Hanana.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On Tuesday, Lombard also took the stand, offering similarly firm denials of misconduct. Under cross-examination by Mkabayi, he acknowledged inconsistencies in procedure, including the failure to record the questions he asked Van Rhyn or document the answers at the time of the interview.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pressed on why there were no contemporaneous notes, Lombard responded that his questioning had been “specific and minimal”, and that he assumed his colleague, a sergeant — whom he saw with a clipboard — had taken notes.</p>



<p>Without records or signed statements from the interrogation itself, Mkabayi questioned the legitimacy of the interview. “What guarantee does this court have that the interview happened as you claim?” she asked.</p>



<p>“My words are that the interview took place,” Lombard responded. “It is mentioned in my statement.”</p>



<p>The disputed interviews resulted in statements that could be admitted as key evidence.</p>



<p>Prosecutors allege that Joslin’s mother, Kelly Smith — accused number three and partner to Appollis — sold her daughter to a sangoma for R20  000, with Van Rhyn and state witness Lourentia Lombaard receiving smaller amounts as hush money.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Joslin, who was last seen on 19  February while in Appollis’s care at the family’s Middelpos shack, remains missing. The three accused have pleaded not guilty and have denied involvement in the child’s disappearance. Smith has not alleged any mistreatment by the police.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lombaard turned state witness late last year. Her testimony has formed a significant part of the prosecution’s case.</p>



<p>Also taking the stand this week was Sergeant Mzamo Mbovane, the officer who drove the vehicle carrying two of his colleagues and Van Rhyn to a mandatory physical examination, which took place after — according to Mkabayi — the alleged torture of her client had already occurred.</p>



<p>Inside the office of Dr Hendrik Nel at Vredenburg Provincial Hospital, where Mbovane was present during the examination, Van Rhyn reportedly told the physician he had sustained injuries, when asked. Mbovane testified that Van Rhyn attributed them to a fall from a friend’s bakkie the day before. </p>



<p>After the consultation, Van Rhyn was sent for X-rays, prescribed Panado and returned to the Sea Border offices to officially make his confession statement, but he allegedly “fell asleep” while there. </p>



<p>Dr Nel appeared via a video link on Thursday. When asked by Mkabayi if Van Rhyn&#8217;s injuries were consistent with falling off a bakkie, he said yes. </p>



<p>According to their plea explanations, the men were made to sit on the ground, knees pulled to their chests, arms around their knees, secured with handcuffs and a metal pipe secured under the knees. They were made to hang between two chairs, bags placed over their heads and were, for hours, repeatedly beaten. </p>



<p>During re-examination, prosecutor Aradhana Heeramun asked if the alleged torture described by both men would have resulted in more severe injuries.  </p>



<p>Dr Nel said there would have been more severe bruising, everywhere. </p>



<p>But it was the testimony of Sergeant Felicia Johnson that garnered the ire of the feisty Mkabayi and Judge Nathan Erasmus this week. </p>



<p>Johnson was the officer responsible for booking the three accused into the Saldanha Bay police station, for their arrest statements, and for having them sign a notice of rights form.</p>



<p>Under cross-examination by Fanie Harmse, acting for Appollis, Johnson said she noticed Appollis had a blue eye, but didn’t inquire about it. (This was a day before Dr Nel&#8217;s testimony. During his testimony, the doctor said he noticed the eye, and that there was bleeding on the sclera. That was usually caused by trauma &#8220;like being hit by something,&#8221; he said.) </p>



<p>During her cross-examination, Mkabayi said Johnson was among the officers who tortured Van Rhyn.</p>



<p>“My client says when his head was covered, he could bite the plastic, and other plastics were added, while those plastics were being added, you fully participated in adding the plastics.”</p>



<p>&nbsp;Johnson denied the allegations.</p>



<p>Erasmus scolded Johnson during the cross-examination, intimating that, at best, her administrative skills were shoddy, and, at worst, there had been an attempt at manipulation of official police forms.</p>



<p>“We aren’t playing games here, these are people’s lives,” said the judge.</p>



<p>The court also heard from Colonel Edward Clark, a veteran with 32 years of service. </p>



<p>Clark, with the Western Cape Serious and Violent Crimes Unit, wasn’t involved in the investigation, but was asked by Hanana to take Van Rhyn’s confession statement on 5  March. This is allegedly just hours after Van Rhyn was tortured.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The start of Clark’s recorded interaction with the suspect was played in the courtroom, where he explained to Van Rhyn his rights and told him he could ask for a lawyer to be present. It also documents Van Rhyn filling in all necessary forms up to that point. </p>



<p>Clark said he cut the interview short because Van Rhyn had said he was hungry, tired and needed to take medication. </p>



<p>“Medical condition, my lord, he was hungry and needed to take pills, so I wasn’t going to go any further,” he told the court.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mkabayi said her client was injured &#8212; not a medical condition &#8212; because of the “torture” the night before and into the early hours. </p>



<p>“He did not state that to me,” said Clark. “It wasn’t even brought to my attention.”</p>



<p>The courtroom was not only the stage for legal arguments this week, but also a place where the pressure of public opinion and digital scrutiny came to a head.</p>



<p>Opening Tuesday’s session, Judge Erasmus addressed what he called an online campaign of cyberharassment directed at the court, prosecutors and defence lawyers.</p>



<p>“There are individuals using artificial intelligence to manipulate publicly available material,” Erasmus said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It undermines the court process and causes unnecessary suspicion in the minds of the public.”</p>



<p>Although he did not name the individuals or groups responsible, Erasmus made it clear he believed the cyberattacks were malicious, perhaps intended to destabilise the case or cast doubt on the credibility of those involved.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He said he had even seen false claims online suggesting he was involved in Joslin’s disappearance.</p>



<p>“Maybe it’s just the times we live in,” Erasmus said. “But we will not be distracted. We will not allow our work to be undermined.”</p>



<p>The matter continues.</p>
