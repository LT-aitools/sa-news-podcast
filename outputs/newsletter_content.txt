Dear News24 Reader,

The Western Cape is sliding into its deadliest time of year, with gang violence shooting up again, as it does every festive season.

Historically, murders and serious assaults spike by up to 15% between October and December – and this year is shaping up to be no different.

The numbers behind the violence are staggering. Between April and September, an average of three gang-related murders a day rocked the Western Cape.

In just six months, 575 gang murders were recorded – more than a quarter of all killings in the province.

In War at Home, News24 delves into how gangsterism has developed into the violent force it is today.
