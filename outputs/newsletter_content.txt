=== Your Top Reader Pics of 2025 📷 - Sat, 27 Dec 2025 05:42 (SAST) ===

You voted. Now see who you voted for! ‌ ‌ ‌ "Which of my photographs is my favorite? The one I’m going to take tomorrow." Imogen Cunningham

AND THE WINNER IS...... Not so fast! Literally thousands of you voted, and every single finalist found scores, if not hundreds, of fans. My personal favourite, sadly, did not win (and I will not disclose which one that was!)

Thank you to everyone who voted or just browsed the best pics of the year.

To the top three: we will be in touch in early January to see about sending you some thank-you goodies.

To the finalists: thank you for your amazing photos, and keep on sending them in!
