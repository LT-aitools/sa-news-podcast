(Photos: Barry Christianson)Isimangaliso Wetland Park’s turtle monitoring programme The iSimangaliso Wetland Park’s turtle monitoring programme runs from October to April, monitoring the nesting season of these reptiles. On 18 November, moments after sunset, Bhekizizwe Siyaya and Celimpilo Ngwane, employed at the iSimangaliso Wetland Park’s turtle monitoring programme, facilitated by Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife, made their way to the coastal dune north of Sodwana Bay in KwaZulu-Natal. Their work serves a crucial purpose for ongoing research into turtle conservation, with the first patrol starting just before sunrise, and the second between 6.30pm and 7pm. Both take about three hours to complete, if they encounter no turtles, as GroundUp’s Barry Christianson reports. You buy one – we donate one!

Zuma’s reckoning? Judge refuses R28.9m legal fees appeal, NPA fights to ‘stop Stalingrad’

The story: While the State’s corruption case against former president Jacob Zuma was declared trial-ready four years ago, it has been delayed by his repeated failed efforts to force the removal of his prosecutor, Billy Downer.

At the same time: While that case was being argued, Gauteng High Court Judge Anthony Millar dismissed Zuma’s bid to appeal his order that he pay back the R28.9 million in taxpayer funds spent on corruption trial defence costs.
