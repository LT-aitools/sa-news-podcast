Bondi Beach leads to tougher gun laws ‌ ‌ ‌ Time to vote for your favourite reader pics!OUR TOP PICSVoting opens for this year’s top reader pics

Every year we like to compile the crème de la crème of our reader-submitted pictures for you to vote. And it’s that time once again!

We have received so many phenomenal entries this year that it made picking a handful of the best a near-impossible job. We have stunning landscapes, pets, other critters, rocks under a microscope, people peopleing, the moon, the sun, action, and so, so, so much more!

You can vote here, but remember that you can only pick one, as hard as it might be.

Happy voting, and may the odds be ever in your favour!

NOTE: We've unfortunately had to remove one of the finalist pictures due to it being uploaded by someone who had not actually taken the photo. This goes against the 'reader's pics' part of our reader's pics, and has been deleted.

The "Baboon blood moon pic over Table Mountain was originally taken by Jay Caboz, a professional photographer. Great pic that it is, it is neither an amateur shot nor submitted by the original photographer.

Dear News24 Reader,

South Africa finds itself stuck in a widening maelstrom of corruption, ineptitude, and violence, while still daring to hope.

This year, it became evident that the worst among us were gaining in their passionate intensity, their hubris giving way to sudden desperation. And it is always lives that are at stake – often the lives of those who pay the price for someone else’s power, greed, or fear.

News24's annual Impact Report revisits the pivotal stories that commanded our attention and defined 2025.

Madlanga Commission helps expose rot within SA’s justice system, but now we must fix it

President Cyril Ramaphosa and the ANC have to stop treating law enforcement like a political football – and actually support the appointment of skilled and ethical police officers who want to keep South Africans safe, writes Karyn Maughan.

The Cat with 9 lives: Matlala at centre of SA law enforcement’s Damascene moment

49-year-old tenderpreneur Vusimusi “Cat” Matlala is a colourful character: disarticulate but impeccably dressed in high-end fashion brands. News24 investigative journalist Jeff Wicks writes about the man at the heart of the implosion of the country’s criminal justice cluster.

Year of the hitman: Mafole and Van Niekerk are only two of 2025's high-profile murders

The hits on Mpho Mafole and Bouwer van Niekerk were the latest high-profile murders in a series of violent deaths of investigators probing corruption and malfeasance involving public funds. Sikonathi Mantshantsha writes that both mirrored the hits on Babita Deokaran and Simnikiwe Mapini years earlier.

Unmasking the X-Boer, the ‘farmer’ who helped influence Trump’s view of South Africa

In April 2025, News24 revealed that Sebastiaan Jooste was behind @Twatterbaas – a conservative X account that had gained influence over Elon Musk and, thereby, Donald Trump’s view of South Africa. The true costs of this disinformation war will only be known in years to come, writes Kyle Cowan.

Trump’s tariff tantrum: Bye-bye piece of American pie

The recent flare-up in tensions between the US and SA over the G20 probably doesn’t bode well for a future trade deal. In addition, as Helena Wasserman writes, new US legislation is currently under consideration that will exclude South Africa from AGOA in the future.

After surviving a tumultuous year, will Godongwana keep his hat on for Budget 2026?

Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana endured and survived three Budget speeches in 2025. Hanlie Nordejee looks back at the minister’s “Ides of March” moment, and how the GNU has apparently changed the way the government operates.

No hope of detente: SA can expect more of the same bullying from Trump in 2026

In 2025, simmering tensions between South Africa and the United States exploded into an outright diplomatic war, redefining the dynamics of their already fraught relationship. During South Africa’s G20 presidency, trade disputes, political clashes, and conflicting geopolitical agendas escalated into dramatic confrontations, writes Amanda Khoza.

SA's GNU survived 2025's uncharted waters, but could it still get lost at sea?

It was a stormy year for the government of national unity, but somehow it made it through intact, writes parliamentary journalist Jan Gerber.

Jozi jazzed up: A crumbling city of gold puts its best dress on for G20 visitors

Johannesburg’s hosting of the G20 Leaders’ Summit highlighted the city’s glaring cracks, from water shortages and crumbling infrastructure to political chaos and leadership gaps, writes Alex Patrick.

The perfect year: Proteas men and women restore SA cricket to its former glory in 2025

In a stellar year for South African sport, the headline must be our cricketers, who reached heights that only recently seemed unattainable, writes Lloyd Burnard.

Royal send-off: Miss SA manages to crown a year that didn't always go that beautifully

After leadership exits, postponed plans and months of silence that nearly derailed this year’s Miss South Africa pageant, Qhawe Mazaleni emerged victorious. Keitumetse Maako takes a look at the highs, lows, and in-betweens the organisation faced in the past year.
