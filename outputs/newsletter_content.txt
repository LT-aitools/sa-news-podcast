A group of recreational divers was exploring the waters of False Bay when they noticed a Hawksbill turtle in distress.

🇰🇵❗️North Korea has condemned an 11-nation sanctions monitoring team, including the US and South Korea, as an “illegal” body outside the United Nations system. Pyongyang dismissed the team’s reports on its malicious cyber activities as fabricated stories, following the team’s formation after Russia blocked a UN monitoring panel in 2024.
