WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING🇺🇸🇧🇷 Trump has once again made America a little greater, by removing his 40% tariffs on Brazilian food products such as beef, coffee, cocoa and fruits. The White House made a U-turn on some tariffs that have led to increased food prices in the US. American retail coffee prices rose as much as 40% this year. 🇺🇸🐷 White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Thursday defended Trump after he called a female reporter “piggy” when she questioned him about Jeffrey Epstein. (Trump leaned toward the reporter, pointed his finger and said, “Quiet, piggy”.) Leavitt said reporters should appreciate his openness in answering questions. Are we being schucksed?  🇧🇷🔥 Talks at the COP30 climate summit in Brazil were disrupted on Thursday by – get this – a fire that broke out in the venue just as negotiators were trying to strike a deal that could strengthen international climate efforts. 🎬💸 Rivals Netflix, Paramount Skydance, and Comcast have each made buyout bids for Warner Bros Discovery, which will determine the future of prized assets such as HBO, DC Comics universe, and the Warner Bros film library.
