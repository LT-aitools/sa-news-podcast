WHILE YOU WERE WORKING🇮🇷👴 Iran’s Supreme Leader is set to address the nation via state television following widespread domestic protests. The rare scheduled speech is expected to outline the government’s official stance on the unrest and its plan for restoring order. International observers are on alert for any signals of policy shifts or a potential escalation in security measures.

🇺🇸🇭🇺 US President Donald Trump has publicly endorsed Hungarian PM Viktor Orbán, wishing him “best of luck” in his upcoming re-election campaign. The gesture reaffirms the strong ideological alliance between both leaders, both champions of conservative, nationalist agendas. This high-profile support from Washington is expected to bolster Orbán’s domestic standing as Hungary prepares for a closely watched electoral contest.

🇷🇺🇺🇦 Russia has launched its Oreshnik hypersonic missile at Ukraine, according to official statements from Moscow. The deployment of this advanced weaponry represents a significant escalation in the conflict's technological intensity and regional risk. International observers are monitoring the development as it marks a potent new phase in the ongoing military confrontation.

🇺🇸🚀 Nasa has confirmed that it has initiated an emergency early return for the International Space Station crew following a significant medical complication involving one of its astronauts. While specific details of the condition remain confidential, the decision highlights the extreme logistical and physical challenges of long-term space flight. The crew is expected to undock shortly to ensure the affected individual receives immediate specialist care on Earth.

=== 2026: What a year it's been... - Sat, 10 Jan 2026 06:17 (SAST) ===

Just kidding. I need a smoke break from the year. ‌ ‌ ‌

“My own morality. My own mind. It’s the only thing that can stop me.”

Donald Trump

2026 starts with a bang

Before most of Joburg had even packed their bags for home, the year started off... hot.

The Trump administration’s abduction of a sitting head of state – however loathsome they may be – has set the tone for the rest of the year. We’re living in Trump’s world, and he reckons there’s nothing we can do about it.

Eurasia Group president and founder Ian Bremmer noted in his weekly newsletter that the world order that US spent decades forming has been torn asunder by Donald Trump.

Note that this is how we’re starting 2026. Sprinkle in South Africa allowing an Iranian warship to sail alongside other BRICS vessels in an exercise off the Cape coast, and we’re in for a year for the record books.

I would not bet on an American escapade in South Africa just yet, mind you. Cuba and Greenland are very much first on the call sheet, but Venezuela’s violent start signalled one thing: that the US is emboldened to act outside of international law and all political norms.

It is only the mid-term elections that might put some ice on the White House’s tiny hands. Neither God nor the rest of the world seems able to.

Rather than invite despotic nations to sail with us, perhaps South Africa would do better to keep our bloody noses clean and heads down. At least until November.

Le combat en cage

If you think the nonsense around the G20 was bad, spare a thought for France and the G7.  The French government has opted to delay this year’s summit because, ahem, it clashes with the cage fight on the White House lawns. Perhaps we dodged an orange bullet by not having the Americans attend G20…
