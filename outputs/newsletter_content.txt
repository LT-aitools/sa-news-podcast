MEDICAL MILESTONE Photo: Netcare SA medicine, par excellence

South African cardiologists have achieved a medical milestone by successfully implanting the nation’s first leadless pacemaker. The tiny device, which is a fraction of the size of a AAA battery, was fitted using minimally invasive techniques that eliminate the need for surgical incisions and lead wires. The breakthrough offers local heart patients a safer, more discreet alternative for managing cardiac rhythms while showcasing the country’s world-class medical expertise. More on this on Netcare’s website.

WHILE YOU WERE WORKING🇾🇪🇸🇦  Yemen’s separatist leader, Aidarous al-Zubaidi, has fled to an unknown location, abandoning critical peace talks in Riyadh. His disappearance has derailed efforts to mend a fractured Gulf coalition and triggered charges of high treason from the Saudi-backed government.

🇨🇳🇹🇼 As if tensions could not get worse, China has banned two Taiwan ministers from entering China for alleged independence activities, sparking a fierce diplomatic backlash from Taipei. The move targets senior officials over their sovereign stance, further escalating cross-strait tensions and straining regional stability.

🇰🇷🇰🇵 South Korean President Lee Jae Myung has urged China’s Xi Jinping to mediate in easing soaring tensions with North Korea. During their recent summit, Lee emphasised Beijing’s vital role in curbing Pyongyang’s nuclear ambitions and fostering regional stability through diplomatic intervention.

🇮🇷🇮🇱 Iran has executed a man convicted of espionage, alleging he provided classified intelligence to Israel’s Mossad agency. The state maintains he was involved in “providing the country’s sensitive information”, marking a further escalation in the long-standing shadow war between the two regional rivals.

JOHANNESBURG

I stumbled across a disturbing scene in a Johannesburg suburb when I saw two barefoot boys in just their underwear next to a private security vehicle. My curiosity and concern drove me to look closer and I ended up uncovering what appeared to be a suspected human‑trafficking operation involving vulnerable young boys.

=== Trump sets a dangerous precedent - Thu, 08 Jan 2026 06:20 (SAST) ===

Massive fires rage in Australia ‌ ‌ ‌ “I have come to the conclusion that politics are too serious a matter to be left to the politicians.”

STORY OF THE DAYTrump’s shredding of international law sets a dangerous precedent

By Peter Fabricius

Donald Trump’s attack on Venezuela will embolden Russia and China, experts believe.

WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING🇺🇸🇺🇳 US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that the US would withdraw from multiple international and UN entities because they “operate contrary to US national interests”. Most concerningly, he plans to pull out of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the “bedrock” climate treaty. Mind you, we are eight days into the new year…

🇬🇧👮‍♂️ London’s Metropolitan Police hired more than 5,000 officers and staff members without doing proper background checks between 2018 and 2023. The Met also could not confirm if another ahem, 17,000 officers and staff, had the correct pre-employment checks.

🇨🇴🇺🇸 President Trump has invited Colombian President Gustavo Petro to the White House, just days after threatening military action against his country. The two apparently had a lekker phone call where they hashed things out.

🇦🇺🔥 Two bushfires of more than 3,000 hectares were raging near the towns of Longwood and Walwa in Australia’s Victoria as temperatures are forecast to exceed 40 degrees C. Adding fuel to the fire, authorities have warned of a “catastrophic” fire danger rating for Friday.

SPORTS🏏 Jason Smith’s call-up to the Proteas T20 World Cup squad has raised eyebrows, but his power-hitting ability could calm those doubts.

⚽ Premier League leaders Arsenal have “a point to prove” when they face Liverpool on Thursday, manager Mikel Arteta said as the North London club look to maintain their commanding advantage at the summit.

🚴 Briton Simon Yates, a two-time grand tour champion, announced his retirement on Wednesday. The 33-year-old, who won the Vuelta in 2018, retired on a high after claiming the Giro d’Italia title last May to add to his six career stage wins in the three-week race.
