The artist James Delaney has publicly credited his dog, Pablo, with inspiring his efforts to rejuvenate The Wilds, an expansive park in Johannesburg.

The Wilds, conveniently close to his flat in Killarney, was an obvious and perfect choice. GroundUp’s Ihsaan Haffejee has more on this wonderful story
