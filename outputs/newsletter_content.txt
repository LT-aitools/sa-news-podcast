FROM GANG BOSS TO MENTOR: WELCOME’S STORY

Meet Welcome Witbooi, a man giving back. Welcome manages campaigns aimed at diverting young people from gangsterism, crime, and drugs in the Cape Flats and Johannesburg, South Africa. A former gang boss turned human rights defender and philanthropist, his work is purposeful and impactful.

Witbooi had to make tough sacrifices backed by courage, mainly having to renounce his gang membership, which has bloody consequences in the world of gangsterism. Witbooi formed BrightSpark Foundation SA in 2018 with the aim of  promoting the social welfare of underprivileged communities, offering diversion programmes, and encouraging young people to build their communities and not to destroy them.

🇬🇧👑 King Charles has officially banished his younger brother, Prince Andrew, of his title of prince and removed him from public life, a move that British politicians, media and the public welcomed, as the monarch moved to protect the institution from Andrew’s ties to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

🇺🇳👨🏻‍⚖️ Forty-three detained local United Nations (UN) staff will face trial on suspicion of links to an Israeli airstrike that assassinated top Houthi leaders in August, according to the acting foreign minister of Yemen’s Houthi government. The UN has repeatedly rejected Houthi accusations that UN staff or UN operations in Yemen were involved.

🇭🇺🇺🇸 Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán hopes to convince Donald Trump that Hungary should be exempted from US sanctions on Russian oil because of its high dependence on pipeline networks for its energy supplies.

🇮🇱🇵🇸 The Israeli military has attacked the Gaza Strip for a third day leaving two people dead, the Palestinian Authority’s official news agency said, in another test of a fragile ceasefire agreement. One Palestinian was killed by Israeli shelling and another was shot dead by Israeli forces, according to the news agency.

=== Proteas, Springboks, Bill DeBlasio - Sat, 01 Nov 2025 05:57 (SAST) ===

Your weekend is already fullSaturday, 1 November 2025

SA sports > your weekend

What a time to be a South African sports lover. The Proteas women continue to fly our flag high, after a year in which it has been prominent in the world of sport. On Sunday, in Mumbai, Laura Wolvaardt and her team will attempt to do something no Proteas team has achieved – win a 50-over World Cup. All that stands in their way is a feisty Indian team and 1.2 billion fans. No problem.

The Proteas are confident and have momentum. India were magnificent in overcoming Australia in their semifinal, chasing down a mammoth 339 to win. Often though, producing a miraculous performance in the semis doesn’t translate to the same standard in the final.

Sometimes a team plays its “final”, before the actual final. Let’s hope that was the case for India at this World Cup. As much as all of SA was behind India against Australia, now our love turns to the Proteas. The match starts at 11.30am on Sunday.And don’t forget, the world champion Springboks face Japan at Wembley in the first of five Tests on their northern hemisphere tour. Kick-off is at 6.10pm on Saturday.

IN OTHER NEWSFinding Bill DeBlasio

When The Times, a UK-based news organisation, tried to reach out to former New York mayor Bill DeBlasio, their junior reporter thought they had stumbled on a scoop of a lifetime, with DeBlasio not just replying to a request for comment about his apparent friend and mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, but turning face and appearing highly critical of him.

Problem was, this was not the Mayor Bill DeBlasio, but a wine importer also named Bill DeBlasio. Problem was, the journalist never asked or addressed him once as a mayor.Whoops. Extra training now scheduled for The Times’ journalist pool.

MADLANGA’S MURMURS

A lot happened at the Madlanga Commission and Parliament’s Ad Hoc Committee this past week. A leaked audio recording captured Vusimuzi “Cat” Matlala admitting to paying large sums to senior politicians, including Senzo Mchunu, allegedly in return for favourable contracts and political influence.

Meanwhile, Lieutenant General Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi’s testimony highlighted alleged systemic corruption and political interference within the police and justice system, and raised alarms about the safety of witnesses in these high-stakes hearings.

Overall though, conversation volumes halved this past week. Key Mkhwanazi cheerleaders - mega influencers, Chris Excel and @joy_zelda - seem to have been less active this week, possibly accounting for the drop. If this is the case, this would highlight the role they play in propping up discussion volumes. Or, is the public’s attention simply shifting from the scandal?

MDN News - the biggest news channel you probably haven't heard of because they primarily cater for the anti-foreigner movement - and the historically EFF-aligned influencer, @Sentletse, filled the gap left by Chris Excel and @joy_zelda. The mainstream media played an important, but lesser role, to these ‘alternative’ news sources.DAILY MAVERICK TODAY

Essay | When children hurt children, it’s time to look in the mirror

A video of a brutal assault at Milnerton High School shocked many of us. We want to look away and distance ourselves from the violence, to see it as the work of bad kids who need to be punished. Jason Bantjes argues that thinking this way might just be part of the problem. Don’t close your eyes, he urges.

Interview | Tinyiko Maluleke on the National Dialogue... and sitting under jacaranda trees

Tinyiko Maluleke is spearheading something that many South Africans have given up on – believing that talking to each other can still fix things. He speaks to Anneliese Burgess about his childhood, a “nation in conversation”, and his love of Tshwane’s jacarandas.

Before forwarding ‘Strawberry Quick’ school drug warning, read this

A viral WhatsApp message claims drug-laced candy is being handed out to children at South African schools. It is nearly identical to a long-debunked global hoax dating back to at least 2007 – and still lacks any evidence to support it, writes Andrew Thompson.

Maya Fisher-French is probably one of the coolest financial people any of us know. She’s smart, savvy, and just so humble and hilarious without even trying. She takes a break from answering Money questions, to answer a few about her beloved Volvo with Janine van der Post.
