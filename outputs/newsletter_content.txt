Good Morning, SA

Ekurhuleni mayor Nkosindiphile Xhakaza may have interfered with and sought to divert the police investigation into the murder of chief auditor Mpho Mafole away from the municipality’s award of a mobile chemical toilets tender, which was the biggest money-spinner for tenderpreneurs associated with councillors.

QAMA QUKULA,

AUDIENCE ENGAGEMENT EDITOR

HUNTED | How Ekurhuleni mayor tried to divert scrutiny from Mpho Mafole’s murder

The story: At Mpho Mafole’s funeral, Mayor Nkosindiphile Xhakaza told mourners Mafole could have been murdered because he was investigating the municipality’s irregular rates clearance and the controversial refurbishment of the SAAME building.

However: Xhakaza knew that was not the case because the municipality had already received third-party audit reports on the irregularities ahead of Mafole’s employment.

What else: Xhakaza avoided mentioning the one thing Mafole was really investigating at the time of his brutal murder – Mafole’s killing came three days after the auditor filed a scathing report criticising the municipality’s award of a chemical toilets tender worth R1.8 billion.
