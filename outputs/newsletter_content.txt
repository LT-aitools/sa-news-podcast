Deep connectionFor all the world to sea

Capetonians and visitors from afar lucky enough to visit the Two Oceans Aquarium will have no doubt walked through the glass tunnels of this well-known landmark at least once before. Whether as a child or an adult, the excitement and wonder of wanting to see everything at once, or years later, never fades. And today, the aquarium celebrates its 30th birthday.

The facility’s commitment to helping people notice the ocean has shaped nearly everything it has done for three decades – educating and raising awareness, playing an active role in conservation and connecting communities with the sea.

WHILE YOU WERE WORKING

🇨🇳🇯🇵 Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi has been warned by Beijing to retract “egregious” remarks about Taiwan or her country will “bear all consequences”. Takaichi sparked a diplomatic row in parliament last week, saying a Chinese attack on Taiwan could amount to a “survival-threatening situation” and trigger a potential military response from Tokyo.

🇨🇳⛓️‍💥Veteran Chinese state media journalist Dong Yuyu has lost an appeal to overturn a seven-year jail term for espionage, in a ruling handed down by Beijing’s high court, his family has confirmed, adding that the decision is “an act of persecution”.

🇰🇷🕊️Tragedy has struck South Korea where at least two people are dead and 18 injured after a light truck crashed into a market, ploughing 150m along a passageway lined with stalls before coming to a halt, according to emergency officials.

🇹🇿🗳️In a turbulent time for Tanzania, President Samia Suluhu Hassan has nominated former finance minister Mwigulu Nchemba as the new prime minister, in the wake of last month’s disputed election. Opponents say Hassan’s government rigged the poll, during which violent protests erupted over the exclusion of her main challengers.
