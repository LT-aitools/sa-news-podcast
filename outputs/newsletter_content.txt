SA youth employment programme hits 200k milestone

A South African initiative focusing on youth employment, Youth Employment Service (YES), has reached a major milestone by creating 200,000 quality work opportunities for young people. This is a significant social development story, as approximately 74% of the participants come from social grant-reliant households, with the programme helping 44,000 families move out of poverty. Critically, these jobs provide future skills in fields suchas tech and green innovation, and a fifth of alumni go on to become entrepreneurs.

WHILE YOU WERE WORKING🇮🇶🇺🇳 Former Iraq president Barham Salih has been chosen by the UN to be the next High Commissioner for Refugees, according to a document dated 11 December. Salih’s appointment for a five-year term breaks with the agency’s tradition of selecting a chief from a major donor state. He faces immense challenges, with global displacement at record levels and a concurrent fall in international funding.

🇷🇺🇺🇸 The Kremlin has indicated it may reject new Ukraine peace proposals following recent talks between Kyiv and US officials about a post-war reconstruction plan.

🇬🇧🇸🇩 The UK has imposed sanctions, including asset freezes and travel bans, on senior commanders of Sudan’s paramilitary Rapid Support Forces. The sanctions target figures linked to mass killings, systematic sexual violence and deliberate attacks on civilians in the ongoing conflict.

🇧🇬🗳️ Bulgarian lawmakers have formally approved the resignation of the minority government following weeks of street protests against state corruption and a proposed tax-hiking budget. The decision puts Bulgaria, set to join the eurozone on 1 January, on the likely path to a snap election.

=== Vote for your reader picture of the year! - Sat, 13 Dec 2025 05:48 (SAST) ===

Let’s talk about your disgusting belly button ‌ ‌ ‌

Newsletters Editor

“My life is shaped by the urgent need to wander and observe, and my camera is my passport.”

Eve Arnold

We have (so many) pictures for you!

One of my favourite things to do in this job is to compile the list of finalists for the Daily Maverick reader pics of the year. Poring through a year’s worth of photos to select a handful is intensely satisfying, and also really challenging.

We receive thousands of pictures every year. From that, we pick only a small collection each week.

We have several regular contributors, such as Jenni Bessessen, who has over the years captured her local Cape Town parks and what can only be presumed is her Labrador, Jamie.

Ndabenhle Sosibo has sent several of the most enthralling landscape photos  I’ve seen this side of amateur photography. If you want to know what “God rays” are in the photographic sense, Ndabenhle’s submissions capture that perfectly.

Tian Oliver took us by surprise, suddenly sending in a steady supply of what I later learnt was photomicrography. Rocks, gems, organic matter under a microscopic lens. He is a finalist for a submission that can at first be mistaken for an abstract brushwork on canvas.

There are literally scores of finalists in our voting form, so please look through them all before casting your vote. You only get one vote! The winner gets significant bragging rights and, if we can convince the DM Shop, some goodies from there.

We’ll be announcing the winners on this newsletter before the new year, so stay tuned.

To anyone who thinks they have a great photo, you probably do, and we’d love to share it with everyone else. If they brighten my day, every day, they certainly will for others.

We’re all filthy

Ever recall your gran telling you to wash behind your ears? Science now has this old-timey advice backed up. A new study showed that the back of ears, between toes and in the belly button all contained far less healthy microbe collections. So, tonight in the tub, be sure to give your belly button a good, soapy swirl. Science demands it.
