WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING🇺🇸🤨 While Trump insisted that his administration has nothing to hide, the White House had been quietly lobbying senators to slow-walk a vote to force the release of the Epstein files. This didn’t go according to plan, because on Tuesday senators approved the release without the changes Trump aides had pushed for. 🇺🇸📑 With that being said, Trump did sign the bill to release the files from the US Justice Department on Wednesday. The files could shed more light on the activities of Epstein, though it may not be comprehensive, because the legislation passed allows the Justice Department to withhold some information. 🇹🇷🇦🇺 Turkey will host next year’s COP31 climate summit, while Australia will lead the conference’s negotiations among governments, said Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.
