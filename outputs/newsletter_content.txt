HOPPER HEROESThe 20,000+ water hoppers doing their part

The Hartbeespoort Dam is visited every Thursday by Dr Kelby English alongside 20,000 tiny insects packaged carefully in translucent containers.

With care, she, along with some local residents, release the tiny insects onto the green carpet of invasive water hyacinth, which now covers almost 40% of the dam.

English, a post-doctoral research fellow at Rhodes University, works at the Centre for Biological Control (CBC), a research centre based in the Department of Zoology and Entomology at Rhodes.

The Megamelus scutellaris, commonly known as the water hyacinth planthopper, feed on the hyacinth. GroundUp’s Ihsaan Haffejee shines a light on the activity.

=== The holidays are coming! - Sat, 06 Dec 2025 05:18 (SAST) ===

RoboCop statue: Part man. Part machine. All cop.  ‌ ‌ ‌

Holiday plans

The silly season is barrelling down at a rate of knots. And if you’re reading this in a post-Christmas party hangover state, we want to just point out when First Thing is having a slight pause.

From 20 December to 4 January, First Thing, Weekend Thing and Sunday Wrap will be replaced with our traditional end-of-year wraps. Each day we’ll bring you the highlights of the year from most of Daily Maverick’s editorial corners.

Included is a host of interesting editions that feature you, the reader. Given the many thousands of photos we’ve received, we’d be remiss in not showcasing the best of the best that you’ve submitted over the year. Look out for the poll coming next week on this.

Zapiro’s best choices and of course, what everyone read the most during 2025, are all coming your way during the holidays. You may be on the beach or cooking a dozen chickens for family lunch, yet we’ll have something great to read regardless.

But as always, we are journalists first. So should Russia actually retreat from Ukraine, or Donald Trump abdicate his throne of power, we’ll towel off from the pool, open our laptops and let you know.
