‘I don’t have that kind of money’: Cat Matlala denies funding Mchunu’s presidential ambitions

Tenderpreneur Vusimusi “Cat” Matlala on Wednesday denied bankrolling suspended Police Minister Senzo Mchunu’s ANC presidential campaign, saying he has never met him.

In a much anticipated hearing of the parliamentary ad hoc committee established to investigate police corruption, Matlala appeared before MPs trying to get to the bottom of KwaZulu-Natal police commissioner Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi’s July allegations of criminal syndicates infiltrating political structures.

Giving testimony before the committee sitting in the Kgosi Mampuru Correctional Facility, where he is being held, Matlala appeared calm as he scrolled through his witness statement, which he had yet to sign.
