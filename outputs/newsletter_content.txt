STORY OF THE DAYHow Mkhwanazi’s allegations against Mchunu stack up almost six months later

By Vincent Cruywagen

Sidelined Police Minister Senzo Mchunu could face further pressure when the commission submits its first report to the President this week.

WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING🇦🇺🚨 Australian police have confirmed that a father and son were the shooters behind the deadly Bondi Beach attack. The death toll has increased to 16, including a rabbi and a 10-year-old. The man filmed tackling and disarming one shooter was identified as Ahmed al Ahmed, who was shot twice and underwent surgery. A crowdfund for him had already raised more than $233,000 to help.

🇺🇸🚓 In Rhode Island, police detained a “person of interest”, following a mass shooting event at Brown University on Saturday.  The FBI stated that the suspect had been arrested at a hotel. The attack left two dead and nine wounded as students sat for exams before their winter break.

🇺🇦🇷🇺 Ukraine has given up its ambitions to join Nato. In exchange, Ukraine will receive security guarantees from Western powers. The announcement was made by President Volodymyr Zelensky during a visit to Berlin, and was aimed at shifting negotiations towards a peace deal with Russia.

🇬🇧🕵️‍♀️ In her first speech as the first female MI6 chief, Blaise Metreweli warned of a significant Russian threat to the UK. Her codename is “C”, and she will evidently be taking precisely zero nonsense from the Kremlin.
