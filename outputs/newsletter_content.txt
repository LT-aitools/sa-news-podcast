STORY OF THE DAYSurprise as Ramaphosa appoints SIU boss Andy Mothibi as SA’s new NDPP

Advocate Andy Mothibi will start leading the National Prosecuting Authority from 1 February after his appointment on Tuesday.

WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING🇬🇱🇺🇸 They may have been half-arsed about Venezuela, but European leaders are quite vocal in support of Greenland. Faced with a renewed threat of US invasion – cannot believe this is a thing – Europe’s leaders have said the country belongs to itself, and to Denmark a little bit.

🍼🇪🇺 Nestle said it was recalling some batches of its infant formula, mostly in Europe, due to possible contamination with a toxin that can cause nausea and vomiting. The company said the recall covered batches sold across Europe, as well as in Turkey and Argentina.

🇺🇸💸 Donald Trump has frozen more than $10-billion in childcare and family assistance to five Democrat-controlled states. Trump has alleged fraud and misuse of funds, to diversity initiatives and pro-Palestinian university protests. If “cruel and vindictive” had a face, it would be a patchy orange.

🎥🐈 Brigitte Bardot is to be buried near the sea on the French Riviera. Saint-Tropez to be exact. Bardot lived most of her later life there, behind high walls and surrounded by the cats, dogs and horses she was devoted to helping. We should all be so lucky.

Lavish send-off: Proposed R11 funeral policy provides hero’s burial for Joburg councillors

The story: Johannesburg is considering a R11.82 a month funeral policy for councillors which will provide a grave at Heroes’ Acre, a police band, and civic honours when they die.

As it stands: The proposed policy includes lavish funeral services with metro police escorts, choir tributes, and catering, but debates over costs and logistics have delayed its approval.

What’s more: Critics argued the policy was less about family support and more about unbudgeted expenses, as councillors lacked employee benefits like medical aid or UIF.
