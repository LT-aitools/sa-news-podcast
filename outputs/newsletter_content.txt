Mzansi’s rising foodie: Meet Nick

A 5FM radio presenter by day, Nick Hamman – who rose through TikTok and has been dubbed South Africa’s Guy Fieri – showcases our beautiful country’s diverse cuisine, in all sorts of environments, in viral food videos.

The Rondebosch Boys’ High alumnus uses his passion for food to put a positive spotlight on South Africa’s intimate link between food, culture, heritage and history from different regions, demonstrating the importance of food to one’s roots, belonging and pride in identity.

As he says, “food is political”, since it is “very deeply tied to memory and nostalgia and history”.

Nick also recently partnered with Mr D, on which select restaurants bear his seal of approval.

His official website has a wealth of information. Click here to keep up with him on Instagram.
