Good Morning, SA

Duduzile Zuma-Sambudla, the daughter of former president Jacob Zuma, allegedly promised the South African men now stranded in Ukraine’s war-torn Donbas region that she would join them in Russia for a year, undergo the same military training and experience the same hardships, including sleeping in the mountains armed with guns and grenades.

AUDIENCE ENGAGEMENT EDITOR

The story: At least 18 South African men, sent for what they believed was bodyguard training, are on the frontlines of the war on Ukraine and are now pleading to be reunited with their families.

What we know: They blame Duduzile Zuma-Sambudla and two others for misleading them into signing contracts compelling them to fight in the war.

What's more: The men told News24 that they have been separated into groups and have no idea how others among them are surviving.

What else: The department now faces scrutiny for reappointing Qamata without the presiding officer’s report, a decision officials admit would not pass today’s tighter checks.
