SA pride on the world stage

Meet Khanyisile, SA’s virtuoso flautist

South African virtuoso flautist Khanyisile Mthetwa continues to raise our nation’s flag high on the global stage, having been named a semifinalist in the Petrichor International Music Competition. This puts her among some of the most exceptional artists and ensembles internationally, including the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra.

Her debut album, African Bird, made a lasting impression on the Petrichor jury with its blend of African identity, classical virtuosity and social consciousness. The album has been praised by critics as ‘‘genre-defying and timeless”, affirming her status as one of Africa’s most visionary classical artists.

Kidnapping and ‘body bags’ – State CaptureTuesday, 11 November 2025

John Stupart

Newsletter Editor

“Someone will always be prettier. Someone will always be smarter. Someone will always be younger. But they will never be you.”

Freddie MercurySTORY OF THE DAYKidnapping and ‘body bags threat’ add sinister edge to SA’s clashing State Capture narrativesBy Caryn DolleyTwo contradictory State Capture scenarios have emerged in South Africa. The one is that Crime Intelligence officers were arrested as part of a sly plot to derail critical investigations. The other is that necessary investigations into Crime Intelligence officers resulted in their legitimate arrests.

Imagine South Africa without journalists.

No corruption exposés. No watchdogs keeping power to account. No one brave enough to turn away bribes. No one giving a voice to vulnerable South Africans.

You’ve read the headlines, watched the attempted bribe video and witnessed how Pieter-Louis Myburgh will not stop until the truth is known. If you appreciate Pieter-Louis’ work and that of all of our journalists fighting for truth, now is the time to step up your support.
