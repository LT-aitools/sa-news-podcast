THE HEROES CLEANING POTCHEFSTROOM

The Aid 4 Animals in Distress organisation received an SOS call from Fur-Get-Me-Knot earlier this month about five newborn kittens discovered in a roof in Westlake, Cape Town. We headed out immediately to help, unsure what we’d find there.

But the real heroes of this story are the residents. Despite not owning a feline, their kindness and quick action saved these little lives, managing to rescue three kittens from inside the roof and, when they realised two had fallen into a narrow gap between walls, broke parts of the wall to reach them.

The kittens are now safe and warm, and feeding well. While there’s still a long road ahead for these babies, the compassion of strangers has given them a fighting chance.For more about Aid 4 Animals in Distress, click here.WHILE YOU WERE WORKING
