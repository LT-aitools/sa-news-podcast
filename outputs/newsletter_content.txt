O Aliens, where art thou? ‌ ‌ ‌        John Stupart Newsletters Editor    “Technology is a word that describes something that doesn’t work yet.” Douglas Adams Turning it off and on again Talking technical difficulties is never really a particularly compelling piece of morning content, but for many of you, accessing your newsletter fix the past week has been tricky. We’re in the process of some rather monumental shifts in our technology. If you thought our website looked quite different, that would be a part of it. The newsletters have not been immune, unfortunately, and an army of technical gremlins have crept into the machines during this process. You may have noticed delays to First Thing or weird formatting. One of the more obvious ones was the hyperspeed looping of any gifs we attached. All we can say is please bear with us. We are working hard at resolving all these problems and have already made big steps towards this. Throwing the gremlins out of the large email collider was a good first step. That being said, if you’ve noticed you’re not getting a specific newsletter that you once received and loved, please double-check your preferences here! We also have some excellent new newsletters that might pique your interest. Joburg, for example, is particularly important, even if you don’t live there. We strongly recommend signing up and keeping a pulse check on the most important city in the country. PICTURE OF THE DAY

Aliens, Saturn, our next spot The European Space Agency has just announced it is launching a mission to Saturn’s moon Enceladus. The purpose? To establish whether life exists elsewhere than our own late capitalist rock or, at the worst, whether it’s habitable at all. On the plus side, at least it’s the ESA doing this and not SpaceX hunting for a new billionaire bunker spot. SPONSORED CONTENT The real business cost of missing routine tasks By Jendamark Automation MURMURS The US has appeared to play an out-sized role in G20 conversations on X since the beginning of 2025. However, much of that volume came from low-quality “buzzers” whose activity artificially inflated the visibility of MAGA-aligned narratives. These accounts aggressively reposted MAGA influencers who were advocating for a boycott of the G20 Summit on the basis of an alleged “white persecution” crisis in South Africa. The same buzzers also amplified South African accounts whose posts - whether intentionally or not - were used to justify and reinforce the white genocide conspiracy narrative circulating in MAGA spaces. Content from accounts such as @TrumpDailyPosts, @MAGAVoice, @daanbarnard, and others was repeatedly boosted to create a feedback loop that made the US withdrawal appear widely supported. This manufactured consensus played directly into the Trump administration’s stated rationale for boycotting the G20 Summit: the claim of systematic persecution of white South Africans. However, when the effect of these buzzers is removed or appropriately scaled, the real conversation emerges – one driven by authentic South African users and mainstream global participants that showed broad support for multilateralism, African agency, and a rules-based international order.
