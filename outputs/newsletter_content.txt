=== End 2025 by filling a child’s tummy - Sat, 20 Dec 2025 05:51 (SAST) ===

What’s in 100 years? ‌ ‌ ‌

“I slept and dreamt that life was joy. I awoke and saw that life was service. I acted and behold, service was joy.”

Rabindranath Tagore

End 2025 with your heart, and someone else’s tummy, full

We’re ending this year’s Weekend Thing as we have for the past two years: becoming active citizens for the best possible cause: feeding hungry kids over the holidays, as they won’t be getting their meals from school.

Rather than me nattering on about why this has become one of the most important things we do each year, I’ve mobilised our Eastern Cape (EC) nuclear weapon, Estelle Ellis, to explain how your donation works:

Daily Maverick and SA Harvest have  launched our third festive season campaign to relieve hunger in the EC. This year, we’ll focus on three holiday programmes where children can be fed and kept safe, despite school nutrition programmes having shut down for the year.

In previous years we’ve raised more than R3-million for food parcels.

Earlier this year, during a presentation to the South African Human Rights Commission, the national director-general of health, Sandile Buthelezi, highlighted that it was of great concern that the Nelson Mandela Bay (NMB) metro, which had not in the past suffered the high levels of severe acute malnutrition experienced in EC rural areas, now had among the highest levels of malnutrition in the province.

We’re starting with NMB, but if we receive enough support, we will take the holiday programme national later in December and January.

More than two dozen children starved to death in the Bay in the past year.

The buckets are more expensive than last year at R1,000 a bucket. They also contain significantly more nutritious food products, a few treats and some cleaning materials – enough to carry a few families through into the new year.

The great news: any donation towards a bucket will do, it is not necessary to contribute the full amount.

A Bucket of Nutrition contains the following:10kg maize meal5kg rice2kg samp500g macaroni500g soup mix (dry)2 × 410g tinned beansBaked beans1 × 400g pilchards500g soya mince400g peanut butter500g instant milk powder2 × 400g tinned mixed veg1kg potatoes / butternut1 pack Morvite / FutureLife econ pack750ml cooking oil1kg sugar1 × 12-pack stock cubes500g salt400g mixed sweets value bag400g extra mixed sweets value bag1 pack family biscuits2 packets of jelly powder750ml dishwashing liquid1 laundry bar1 bottle Jik / detergent (small)Total Estimated Cost: R848

We are aiming to distribute 2,000 buckets this year.

Why holiday programmes?

We’ve chosen to partner with three organisations that are running holiday programmes or assisting vulnerable children during this time.

In the June/July holidays, the NMB metro was rocked by the brutal murders of several girls. Ibanathi Peter (17) and Sinothando Malinga (19) were found raped, killed, and their bodies burned in KwaNobuhle, Kariega, around 18 June 2025. Four men were arrested and are awaiting trial.

Lithaliyanda Ntoni (12) was found murdered near her house. Her brother-in-law, who claims to be a pastor, was arrested, and faces charges of kidnapping, murder and defeating the ends of justice. Michelle Ambraal (12) was found murdered in an open field in Bethelsdorp in July 2025, less than a block from her home.

We support community workers who believe that holiday programmes can and will keep our children safe.

What will we be supporting?

The Missionvale Care Centre, which runs an active holiday programme, the Walmer Angel Project that feeds children continuously throughout the holidays, and the MTR Smit Children’s Haven.

We decided to support the programmes at Missionvale and Walmer Angels because the women in both instances are already feeding and supervising children, they understand household dynamics and can accurately determine beneficiaries, knowing which families are most vulnerable, with the trust of the community to ensure safe, dignified, organised distribution.

We will also be assisting the MTR Smit Children’s Haven with buckets. Tanya Eales from MTR explained that they need food to send home with the vulnerable children in their care. These kids go home to their families for the festive season but often don’t have sufficient access to food during that period. The home hopes to address this issue.

We need your help

We know that we can, once again, deliver a Christmas miracle to these families in need.

100-year-old Italians: their secret

While the rest of us spend a lot of our holiday shortening our lifespans with poor dietary choices, Italians who reach the age of 100 apparently have a secret edge: hunter-gatherer DNA. A specific genetic branch of western hunter-gatherers, found in no one else, contributed significantly to Italian long life. That and olive oil, no doubt...
