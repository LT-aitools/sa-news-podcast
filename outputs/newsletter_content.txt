Despite the Constitutional Court’s prima facie findings of dishonesty against then-prosecutions boss Menzi Simelane, he is one of six chosen candidates vying for the National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP) position he was ousted from.

Fit and proper? Menzi Simelane an NDPP candidate despite ConCourt questioning his integrity

The story: Former prosecutions boss Menzi Simelane is one of the six candidates shortlisted for the National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP) post.

What we know: Current NDPP Shamila Batohi will retire in January, leaving President Cyril Ramaphosa with less than two months to replace her.
