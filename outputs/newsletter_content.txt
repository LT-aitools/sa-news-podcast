STORY OF THE DAYMaduro’s capture risks making things worse

By J Brooks Spector

The precise US military action that snatched Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro from his residence may help drive the possibilities for a more successful Venezuelan future — but in all likelihood, it will worsen the situation.

WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING🇺🇸🇻🇪 Nicolás Maduro has barely changed pants since his abduction, and already Donald Trump is threatening Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodríguez. On Sunday, Trump warned that Rodríguez could pay a “bigger price” if she doesn’t “do what’s right”. It’s 5 January 2026.

🇮🇷✊🏽 Various rights groups have reported that at least 16 people have been killed during a week of violence in Iran. The largest protests in three years have erupted 🇮🇷 in the country, following unchecked inflation and general dissatisfaction with the regime.

🇳🇬💥 At least 30 people were killed in an attack at a market in Nigeria’s Niger State. Gunmen opened fire at the Kasuwan Daji market on Saturday, setting fire to stalls and looting.

🇿🇦🇨🇲 Bafana Bafana’s hope of winning a second Africa Cup of Nations title was dashed after they fell to a 2-1 defeat to Cameroon in the round of 16. Cameroon now faces the host nation, Morocco. If you were looking to sport for a cheerful start to your work week, you’d be disappointed.
