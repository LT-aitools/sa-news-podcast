STORY OF THE DAYBig-spending Steenhuisen faces scrutiny as DA fallout over axed Dion George continuesBy Rebecca DavisIn the aftermath of Dion George’s controversial axing as environment minister, questions are being asked about DA leader John Steenhuisen’s alleged financial troubles.

WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING

🇵🇸🇺🇳 The UN Security Council has voted through a US proposal to end all hostilities in Gaza and establish an international “stabilisation” force. The “Board of Peace” will be chaired by Donald Trump. Hamas has so far refused to disarm itself, creating an immediate obstacle to this process.

🇺🇸🗳 After Trump gave a tiny thumbs up, the House is likely to vote as soon as today to force the release of the Epstein files. Trump’s latest statement on the matter was that “we have nothing to hide”.

🇫🇷💧The most French matter is being debated today: Is Perrier “natural” water? A French court will rule on whether the iconic bottled water must be withdrawn from shelves, after it emerged in the media that it had been illegally treated to prevent contamination, exposing a cover-up that went to the highest levels. Expect a feature movie any year now...

🇫🇷🏺The Louvre has closed a gallery due to structural weakness near the Greek ceramics section. Weak beams forced the closure. Presumably before any further ne’er-do-wells lurk by.
