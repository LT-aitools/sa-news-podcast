Poland gets GTA VI parliamentary grumpinessSaturday, 15 November 2025

John Stupart

“However, the regime’s propaganda forces paint Burkina Faso in a very different light. All appears well in the digitally constructed alternate reality of President Ibrahim Traoré. In deepfake videos seen by millions worldwide, the country’s president is beloved by international stars such as Justin Bieber and Beyoncé.”Raphael Parens

G20, less a fewIf you don’t live in Joburg, you’d be forgiven for wondering what all the hullabaloo is about next week. If you do live in Joburg, the fresh paint, G20 banners in Sandton and general air of busy-work are unmistakable. No one is buying it, and there’ll still be lots to do when the presidents fly away.

We’ll be covering the G20 from every angle, sending an elite cadre of journalists. I’ll also be going, but I’ll be telling you what G20 smells like, not what it means for South Africa’s economic development pathway.

Regardless of policy or potpourri, we have you covered. Sign up here for our dedicate G20 coverage, and you’ll be up to date before you can even whisper where’s JD Vance at?

Poland does not kid about GTA

When another delay in the release of Grand Theft Auto 6 was announced, far-right Polish parliamentarians were not happy.  Witold Tumanowicz, of the Confederation Liberty and Independence coalition, took a break from spewing medieval nonsense to express outrage at the delay. “Frankly, if people don’t take to the streets after something like this, I don’t know what will happen.” Point-scoring for the “youths”, or just outright immature parliamentary antics? Why not both?

Murmurs

Conversation on X around the #MadlangaCommission and Parliament’s #AdHocCommittee has declined from earlier peaks but still generated roughly 100,000 posts this week, a very high volume by South African standards.

The agenda was driven largely by “alternative voices” including anti-foreigner media pages, paid mega-influencers and politicised commentators, with only SABC News and Newzroom Afrika notably visible as traditional newsroom anchors in the conversation network.

Discussion centred on CCTV-exposed “rogue” EMPD operations and the suspension of Brigadier Julius Mkhwanazi, which users treated as symptoms of systemic patronage and political protection rather than isolated misconduct in Ekurhuleni.

Commentators repeatedly linked the Ekurhuleni saga to General Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi’s #kznsapsmediabriefing and broader allegations of SAPS corruption and political interference, arguing that both the Madlanga inquiry and the Ad Hoc Committee must confront “systemic rot” across the criminal justice system.

Updates from the parliamentary hearings - especially Cedric Nkabinde’s contested testimony, alleged perjury and questions around figures like Stuart Scharnick James and Vusimusi “Cat” Matlala - were framed as evidence of entrenched patronage networks and long-running failures by the NPA to prosecute high-level corruption.
