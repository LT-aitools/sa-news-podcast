Will the last person to leave the SA Post Office please switch off the lights

By Hugh Corder

My search for a post office from which to physically mail items finally led me to what may be one of the very last functioning outlets in Cape Town.

Why our children can’t do maths — it is a matter of teachers who cannot or will not teach

By Michael Le Cordeur

Much has been written about the poor performance in South Africa in maths and science since the results of the latest Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) were announced. Unfortunately, much of this is based on ignorance and misconceptions.

Pretoria — a new story emerges among the ghosts of the city’s past

By Marianne Thamm

It is known by many names – Jacaranda City, Snor City, capital city of South Africa – and many people have claimed it for themselves, but these days the city is writing its own story anew.

Out of the closet: Releasing the multi-cultural strands of the origins and beauty of Afrikaans

By Marianne Thamm

The life of writer CJ Langenhoven is a source of both comedy and heartbreak in what it reveals.

Constitutional Court’s ‘Please Call Me’ ruling is a disturbing reflection on the judiciary

By Professor Balthazar

The litigation between Nkosana Makate and Vodacom is now way into its second decade. In 2000, Makate conceived the Please Call Me idea while working at Vodacom. The next year, Vodacom launched the Please Call Me service.

The Tesla, Trump & Twitter guy is way too functional, too mercenary, too glib, too lacking in humanity and any kind of self-awareness, and too morally compromised to be any kind of philosopher king.

We Afrikaners are once again skunks

By Max du Preez

For years, Solidarity and AfriForum have been nagging the US to view Afrikaners as victims, but only with a madman in the White House could this happen. Now we other Afrikaners must step in and show that we are not all like that.

Expropriation Act damages all South Africans — a reply to Tembeka Ngcukaitobi

An open letter to Capetonians: When reluctant neighbours push back on homelessness initiatives, nation-building suffers

By Leanne Porter

I want to address reluctant neighbours. Whether you live on a quiet cul-de-sac or in a bustling block of flats, please know this: you live in South Africa.
