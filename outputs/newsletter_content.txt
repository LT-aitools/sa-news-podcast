A powerful narrative of reclamation and success has unfolded in Franschhoek, where Paul Siguqa has officially opened the doors to Klein Goederust, the region’s first 100% black-owned wine cellar. Siguqa, whose mother worked as a labourer on a nearby farm for decades, purchased the dilapidated property in 2019 and spent years restoring it into a premier boutique destination.

The Western Cape Minister of Agriculture, Economic Development and Tourism, Dr Ivan Meyer, celebrated the landmark, hailing the opening as “a triumph for real transformation and inclusive growth in one of South Africa’s most iconic sectors”. He emphasised that the milestone demonstrated what was possible when the government, industry and entrepreneurs worked together. Read more about this here.

This milestone serves as a definitive case study in meaningful agricultural reform, showing how passion and investment can reshape a traditionally exclusive industry. By turning a family legacy of labour into one of ownership, this venture stands as a vital symbol of progress for a sector that remains a cornerstone of the South African economy. For more information, visit the farm’s website.

WHILE YOU WERE WORKING🇲🇲 🚩Myanmar’s military junta claims ousted leader Aung San Suu Kyi remains in good health following concerns from her son, Kim Aris, who fears for the 80-year-old’s life while she is held incommunicado. Aris has dismissed the statement as a baseless fabrication intended to legitimise upcoming elections, which critics label a sham, while demanding independent proof of his mother’s wellbeing.

🇦🇺🪦 Naveed Akram, alongside his father Sajid, have been charged with terrorism and 15 counts of murder following an Isis-inspired shooting carried out at a Bondi Beach Hanukkah celebration. As funerals begin for the victims, the New South Wales government has pledged urgent gun law reforms to address how the pair, who had links to extremists, accessed high-powered weapons.

🇰🇷 ⚖️ South Korean lawmakers are pursuing legal action against Coupang CEO Bom Kim after he skipped a parliamentary hearing regarding a massive data breach affecting 33 million customers. Lawmakers dismissed Kim’s overseas commitments as an excuse to mock the public, while the e-commerce giant now faces potential multibillion-dollar fines and new legislation aimed at tightening data protection penalties.

🇺🇦🔥  A Ukrainian drone strike ignited a fire at Russia’s Slavyansk oil refinery overnight, targeting critical infrastructure in the Krasnodar energy hub to disrupt military fuel supplies. While the refinery blaze was contained without casualties, falling debris injured two civilians and triggered widespread blackouts affecting 38,000 residents as Kyiv continues its campaign against Moscow’s war-funding exports.

🇦🇺🗣️ Australia will introduce new reforms to crack down on hate speech after the country’s worst mass shooting in decades at Bondi beach. The new legislature would make it easier to charge people promoting hate speech and violence, and increase penalties.

🇺🇸🏗️ A judge ruled that Trump’s demolition of the White House’s east wing to build a ball room can continue for now, rejecting an emergency bid which calls it an abuse of power. Trump has also installed gold decorations throughout the Oval Office and paved over the Rose Garden’s lawn to create a patio resembling Mar-a-Lago. Glad to see he’s keeping busy with important matters.

🇵🇸🇮🇱 Humanitarian operations are at risk of collapsing in the Palestinian territories if Israel does not lift certain registration impediments, according to the UN. Many aid groups face de-registration by the end of December, which will force them to close within 60 days.
