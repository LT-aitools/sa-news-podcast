Empowering kids from the Winelands

The work of The Pebbles Project enables children from farming communities to access quality education programmes and health, nutrition and social work services.

Since its inception in 2004 the organisation has positively affected the lives of thousands of children, partnering with local farms to establish and manage early childhood development and after-school clubs for children who either live on a farm or whose parents work on one.

Their work covers Stellenbosch, Somerset West, Wellington, Citrusdal, Clanwilliam, Grabouw and the Hemel-en-Aarde Valley in Hermanus.
