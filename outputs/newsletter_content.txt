THE HEROES CLEANING POTCHEFSTROOM

A group of young locals from Potchefstroom, brought to light via the Instagram channel coolstorybru_za, have begun cleaning up and renovating their city at no cost. The activity began with 22-year-old Potch local Peterson Sebati, who had grown tired, frustrated and ultimately fed up with seeing his city in a dire state.

Together with other locals and friends, he began restoring and fixing public parks, bus stops, taxi ranks, post offices and schools (to name a few) in an effort to see his city restored, in the absence of government service delivery.

To keep the work going, Sebati then funded an NGO, Retsa Tsela (meaning “pave a way”). To support their work you can click here. Find more info on the NGO here.

Watch Sebati’s interview with Radio 702 here.

WHILE YOU WERE WORKING

🇳🇱🗳️ Voting has opened in the Netherlands. Key issues with high stakes face Dutch voters in this election cycle, marked by anti-immigration nationalism, spearheaded by populist Geert Wilders. As nationalism tops polls across the UK, France and Germany, the Dutch national election is a test of whether populism can expand its reach or has peaked in parts of Europe.

🇵🇭⚖️ Former Philippines president Rodrigo Duterte has appealed a decision by the International Criminal Court (ICC) to continue its crimes against humanity case against him, and is demanding his release. The court ruled that it had jurisdiction over his case, as Duterte’s team contested that the court never opened a comprehensive investigation into alleged crimes in the Philippines until the country withdrew from the ICC in 2019.

🇵🇰❗️Pakistan’s defence minister has threatened to “obliterate” the ruling Taliban in neighbouring Afghanistan, marking a dramatic escalation in rhetoric after talks of lasting peace between the South Asian nations. Truce negotiations finished in Istanbul without a “workable solution” – a blow for peace in the region after this month’s deadly clashes.

🇨🇳🇹🇼 China has said it “absolutely will not” rule out the possibility of using force over Taiwan. The statement has struck a much tougher tone than a series of articles in state media this week, which pledged benign rule if the island comes over to Beijing. China, which views democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory, has never renounced use of force to “reunify” with the island.

=== Who knew SA could fix things? - Thu, 30 Oct 2025 06:04 (SAST) ===

Trump meets China’s Xi for trade war talks

Thursday, 30 October 2025

Ernst Calitz

“Puns are the highest form of literature.”  Alfred Hitchcock STORY OF THE DAYNo load shedding, running trains… Who knew South Africa could fix thingsBy Stephen GrootesIt has been obvious since June 2024 that the current national government coalition would endure if voters believed it was improving their lives. Now, there is some evidence that, in certain areas, life is improving for many (but probably not most) people. And, it is often in areas where the ANC has dramatically changed policies that were once foundational to the governing political party's core beliefs.

Change is unpredictable – but it’s also full of potential. At Ninety One, we move with change, and not against it.WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING

🇺🇸🇨🇳 US President Trump met with an expressionless Xi Jinping, and dubbed it the “G2” on Truth Social, to discuss a possible trade war truce. Proof that you only need two clowns to have a circus in Busan, South Korea.

🌀🥀 Hurricane Melissa tore through the northern Caribbean on Wednesday, after thrashing Cuba’s second-biggest city. Hundreds of rural communities were isolated in Cuba, at least 25 people were killed in Haiti, and Jamaica is a disaster area, struck by the strongest hurricane to directly hit its shores, with an estimated $22-billion in damages and economic loss.

🇵🇸🇮🇱 Israel says it’s still committed to the US-backed ceasefire, as it bombarded Gaza all day in retaliation for a soldier’s death, with health authorities saying the total death count reached 104 people.

🇳🇱🗳️ Half of all votes in the Dutch national elections have been counted by early Thursday, and it looks like the centrist D66 party, led by Rob Jetten, is on track to win and defeat the far right.PICTURE OF THE DAY

🏏 Proteas captain Laura Wolvaardt clubbed a sensational 169 off 143 balls while Marizanne Kapp took 5-20 to help South Africa beat England by 125 runs and reach their first-ever Cricket World Cup final.

🏉 Bulls and Springbok hooker Jan-Hendrik Wessels has failed in his appeal to overturn a nine-week suspension for allegedly grabbing the genitals of an opponent, but has had his suspension reduced by one game.

🏉 The Sharks ownership and management have confirmed a series of significant changes with head coach John Plumtree vacating his position “by mutual consent” at the end of the current URC season.
