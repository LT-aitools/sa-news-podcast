Women’s waste opportunity

Green is the colour of changeIn the winelands of Franschhoek, entrepreneur Jocelyn van der Ross is building a business, transforming waste into opportunity. Her company, Green Spot Trading, has grown from a small-scale operation into a trusted partner for local municipalities, having expanded into Paarl.

With new vehicles, protective equipment and a growing team, Jocelyn has created seven jobs in four years, adding to her team which now comprises 44 employees. Her story is a powerful example of how women, when given the right support, drive tangible change in South Africa’s recycling sector.

🇵🇭🌀 The death toll from Typhoon Kalmaegi has climbed to four, according to disaster officials. The powerful storm unleashed heavy rains and floods across central Philippines, submerging homes and forcing thousands to evacuate. Three people are confirmed dead and at least one person has been reported missing in the central province of Cebu.

🇰🇷⛪️ Han Hak-ja, the leader of the Unification Church, has been temporarily released from a South Korean jail on medical grounds following a court ruling. Han has been accused of instructing the church to bribe former first lady Kim Keon Hee for favours for the church’s business interests. 🇷🇴🕊️ A Romanian worker, trapped for hours under the rubble of a partially collapsed medieval tower near the Colosseum in central Rome, has died, Italian and Romanian authorities have confirmed.

🇹🇷⛓️‍💥 Turkish nationalist leader Devlet Bahceli, an ally of President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has said it “would be beneficial” to release former pro-Kurdish party leader Selahattin Demirtas from prison, in a rare signal of support from a figure long hostile to Kurdish political demands.
