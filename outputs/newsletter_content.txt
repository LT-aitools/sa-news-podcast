Early last month, 11 critically endangered African penguins were released back into the ocean at Lookout Beach in Plettenberg Bay.

Led by a resilient shark attack survivor named Baby Shark, the group was rehabilitated through a collaborative local conservation initiative.

It was the largest single release by the programme, which has returned 140 penguins to the wild since its inception in 2017. The Knysna-Plett Herald has more on this uplifting story.

STORY OF THE DAYTrump escalates threats to take Greenland after mixed global response to Venezuela

By Peter Fabricius

WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING🇺🇸🇻🇪 Garbed in prison clothing, Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has pleaded not guilty to narcotics charges. Maduro appeared in a New York federal court, where he said, “I am innocent. I am not guilty. I am a decent man. I am still president of my country.” His fellow citizens may disagree on some of those claims...

🇺🇸🛢️ It was fairly obvious, but several oil bigwigs have confirmed that the Trump administration never consulted them before its Venezuelan attack. The claim contradicted Trump’s assertion that all US oil companies had been spoken to “before and after” Maduro’s capture.

🇯🇵🫨 A magnitude-6.2 earthquake hit Japan’s Chugoku region on Tuesday. A series of aftershocks was reported as well, but there was no danger of a tsunami or damage to the local nuclear plant.

Good Morning, SA

A move to stop schools from failing pupils in grades 1 to 3 could be on the cards, according to comments in a report drawn up by the Department of Basic Education.

AUDIENCE ENGAGEMENT EDITOR

Grade expectations: Momentum builds to abolish grade repetition for young pupils

The story: A document by the Department of Basic Education stated that experiences in countries that have opted for automatic grade promotion at the primary level should be examined carefully.

However: Experts warned that automatic progression without adequate teacher support and resources could worsen learning gaps in literacy and numeracy.

For context: In 2019, the Council of Education Ministers, comprising former minister of basic education Angie Motshekga and the nine education MECs, decided not to allow pupils in grades 1 to 3 to repeat any longer, but the decision has yet to be implemented.
