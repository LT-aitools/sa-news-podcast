Incredible talent

Young Joburg Ballet School dancers from Soweto, Alexandra and Braamfontein showcased their talent in the Seasons of Dance year-end showcase at the Soweto Theatre.

The collaboration with Maison De La Dance was a triumph, thrilling the packed theatre.

Coordinator Keke Chele highlighted the school’s excellent examination results, with 50 students earning 42 distinctions and eight merits in the Cecchetti grading system. GroundUp’s Ihsaan Haffejee reports.

WHILE YOU WERE WORKING🇮🇩🔥 Twenty people are confirmed dead after a fire broke out in a seven-storey building in the Indonesian capital of Jakarta. The blaze started on the first floor and spread to the upper floors.

🇱🇹🇧🇾  A state of emergency has been declared by Lithuania over smuggler balloons originating in Belarus which have disrupted aviation. A request to parliament to allow the military to operate alongside the police and border guards has been filed.

🇺🇳🇸🇩 UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi has warned that advances by the Rapid Support Forces in Sudan could trigger a new refugee exodus. The paramilitary group took over Darfur’s city of al-Fashir in October, in one of its biggest gains in the two-and-a-half-year war with Sudan’s army, while advances have continued eastward into the Kordofan region.

🇳🇬❗️States in Africa’s Sahel region have accused Nigeria of violating their airspace, saying one of its military transport planes landed in Burkina Faso on Monday without clearance.

WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING🇦🇺📱In a world first, Australia’s teenage social media ban began today. Any child under the age of 16 will not have access to TikTok, YouTube, Instagram or Facebook. Ten of the major platforms had to block children from midnight or face stiff fines.

🇨🇩🇷🇼 The United Nations has reported that roughly 200,000 Congolese have fled the eastern DRC. Rwandan-backed M23 rebels were advancing on the key town of Uvira, near the border with Burundi. The Trump-backed ceasefire appears to be firmly over.

Power was out simultaneously for roughly half the residents of Kyiv on Tuesday. Restrictions applied to public lighting and decorative elements throughout the country. Not even a Russian invasion can cause Stage 6 load shedding...

🇬🇧👀 As if in a counter to Australia, a new study by British regulator Ofcom reported that Britons watch YouTube on average 51 minutes per day. Adults spend roughly 4.5 hours online a day, with YouTube the most popular service.
