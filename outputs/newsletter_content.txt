=== Look busy, G20 is coming - Sat, 22 Nov 2025 06:27 (SAST) ===

Nukes & UFOs, who'd have thunk it? ‌ ‌ ‌        John Stupart Newsletters Editor    “Instead of hitting home runs, sometimes we’re going to hit singles. But they’re really important singles.” Barack Obama, G20 Toronto Blue lights, hot smoke, many words If you drive from OR Tambo to Sandton, and then to Nasrec, you are on the best painted, repaired and groomed roads in the country right now.  Take the Killarney offramp on the M1 South and just opposite — funnily enough – the former US Consulate – and you’ll see a resident pothole so big you could hide a medium-sized toddler in it. Look up in the sky and you may hear, or see, an Air Force Gripen or Hawk flying around securing the skies from nefarious actors. Know that the military moved heaven and hell to both pay for the avgas, and get the aircraft ready to fly despite hopelessly inadequate budgets. If arse-about-face was a place, it would be the areas and routes leading to Nasrec. All that being said, it’s crucial to bear in mind how a G20 plays out on several strata.  For us South Africans, it’s all eyes on our president and how he navigates the international pressures now exerting upon his leadership.  This is of obvious interest to us, but browse overseas and this barely registered a single kilobyte of news.  Should the G20 result in a Ramaphosa-led standing of ground to US bullying from abroad, there is every possibility that this could be a watershed moment in international relations, where much of the world finally turns its back on the White House. More likely not, but we live in hope. Daily Maverick has deployed its crack team to Nasrec to cover anything and everything you might be interested in. SEAL Team Ses, if you will.  We’ll be sending daily updates and publishing reports regularly. If we don’t, it means our team’s been extra-renditioned to eSwatini and negotiations have begun. Big or small, whatever the outcome, we’ll be there to cover it. Read more about our SA Hedge funds PICTURE OF THE DAY

The peer-reviewed truth is out there What academics do, if you’re not an acedemic yourself, may often seem a bit of a mystery. In this case, however, very important work has been published that needs to cross the bridge from university to the general public: A new properly published article has established that the prevalance of “unidentified anomalous phenomena”, UFOs to you and I, increased significantly during the testing of nuclear weapons. If an alien species were ever to take in interest in us, the giant species-ending explosions would probably be a good time to check in.
