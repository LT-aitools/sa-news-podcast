WHILE YOU WERE WORKING🇺🇸🇩🇪 The Trump administration is helping Bayer fight thousands of lawsuits claiming its Roundup weedkiller product causes cancer. It told the supreme court that since federal law approved the label, states cannot allow lawsuits claiming the label should have included a cancer warning. The news caused Bayer’s stock price to jump. 🍏🇮🇳 Apple does not plan to comply with an order from the Indian government to put the state’s security app, Sanchar Saathi, on all new iPhones. Although the app is meant to track stolen phones, critics worry it will allow the government to spy on people. Apple says this mandatory installation creates big security and privacy problems for its devices. 🇭🇰⚖️ A judge-led inquiry has been launched into the deadly Hong Kong fire that killed at least 151 people. The investigation will focus on the cause and rapid spread of the blaze, specifically the role of substandard renovation materials. Police have also arrested 25 people. 🇯🇵🔌 Local Japanese officials are preparing to vote on partially restarting the huge Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant, which has been closed since the 2011 Fukushima disaster.

To gatecrash or not? ‌ ‌ ‌        John Stupart Newsletters Editor    “The highest form of wealth is the ability to wake up every morning and say, I can do whatever I want today.” Morgan Housel STORY OF THE DAYSA not invited to first G20 meeting in US this month By Peter Fabricius South Africa is unlikely to gatecrash — though at least one other G20 member thinks it should. WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING🇷🇺🇪🇺 Vladimir Putin has warned European leaders that any war with Russia would end in absolute defeat. Putin’s remarks were in response to warnings of European armament, and evidently paid no mind to the Russian military’s current obvious shortcomings. 🇺🇸💵 President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he will be announcing his new Federal Reserve chief early next year. Online betting has economic advisor Kevin Hassett tipped for the top spot. 🇺🇸⛔ And from the sane to the Trumpiest of news: During an announcement of the freezing of all immigration applications from 19 non-European countries – South Africa is amazingly not on the list – Trump referred to Somalis as “garbage”, saying “we don’t want them in our country”. 🇷🇺🇺🇦 Vladimir Putin was still saying ‘nyet’ to the latest Ukrainian peace proposal. Moscow talks between Putin, special envoy Steve Witkoff, and Jared Kushner carried on for five hours, although ultimately with no useful result yet.  PICTURE OF THE DAY
