The special residents of St Lucia St Lucia, a popular destination on the KwaZulu-Natal north coast, draws holidaymakers for diverse activities, from sport fishing and birdwatching, to guided game drives and swimming off the flawless shores of the nearby Cape Vidal Nature Reserve.  Yet, as Barry Christianson for GroundUp reports, the area’s true spectacle is its incredible population of hippos, as the town serves as the gateway to Lake St Lucia, southern Africa’s largest estuarine lake and the habitat for an estimated 1,000 of these colossal, semi-aquatic mammals often seen partially submerged in the estuary’s shallow expanse, and captured in this photo essay.
