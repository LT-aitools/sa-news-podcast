Craig's Story

From homelessness to mountain guide

In a world obsessed with curated perfection, it’s a rare and powerful thing to witness a story of raw, unfiltered resilience. Meet Craig Links, a man whose journey from the cockpit of a plane to the cliffs of Table Mountain is a profound lesson in finding your path, even when the map has been torn to pieces.

Craig’s life has been marked by life’s highs and lows. He has worn many hats – a pilot, a senior flight attendant and mobile DJ. To many, this would be a lifetime of achievement.

But life, as it often does, had other plans. A series of professional setbacks and hardships saw Craig lose his home, forcing him to live out of his car. In a single, brutal blow, he lost almost everything, including a lifetime of memories. “There’s a moment up there where the noise of life fades away, and you discover a strength you didn’t know you had,” Craig says, reflecting on the mountains that became his sanctuary.

Craig is now a passionate mountain guide, dedicating his life to exploring and sharing the beauty of Table Mountain National Park. He has found solace in the mountains and is now working tirelessly to rebuild his life.

Should you wish to support Craig, you can do so through his Backabuddy campaign. WHILE YOU WERE WORKING

🇺🇸🛂 The Trump administration has revoked around 80,000 non-immigrant visas since its inauguration in January, an official said. That’s an unprecedented crackdown, leading to the deportation of thousands, including some still holding valid visas and documentation.

🇺🇸🚨 Speaking of, balaclava-wearing US immigration agents entered a daycare in Chicago, and apprehended one of the teachers. They dragged her out the door, while she was kicking and screaming, saying that she had papers. Why arrest her while also traumatising the children?

🇰🇵😡 North Korea has slammed fresh US sanctions that were imposed on Thursday and vowed to respond accordingly. The country’s vice foreign minister in charge of US affairs also called the sanctions “silly”, which is totally goofy.

☕️🪧 Unionised Starbucks baristas ☕️ – which has to be the most millennial phrase – have voted for an open-ended strike on Red Cup Day, just before the high-traffic holiday season. Starbucks Workers United are demanding contracts that reflect better pay and job protections.
