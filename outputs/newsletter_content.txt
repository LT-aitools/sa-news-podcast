For Cetric, green is the colour of kindness

Cetric Mphofela is passionate about keeping the environment clean. Since 2021 he has taken on the huge challenge of waste and pollution, one meaningful project at a time. Now, he’s planning his biggest quest yet: a long walk to preserve and protect Mother Nature.

The Laezonia resident is also the proud founder of the Cetric Mphofela Foundation, and his efforts have gone far beyond simple awareness – he’s also been involved in rescue efforts and promoting the preservation of the environment, emphasising the need to refrain from unnecessary tree cutting.

“My ultimate goal is to travel throughout South Africa, educating communities about environmental conservation and promoting collective responsibility for cleaning initiatives,” he says.Cetric has taken part in many clean-ups across a number of areas in Gauteng, including the Hennops, Kaalspruit, Jukskei, Crocodile, Braamfontein Spruit, Diepsloot, Tembisa and Laezonia, as well as Limpopo.
