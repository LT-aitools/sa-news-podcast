Dorothy ParkerSTORY OF THE DAYFrom CIA to Crime Intelligence: Brown Mogotsi’s testimony in five sensational claimsBy Vincent CruywagenIn testimony that sounded more Hollywood than judicial inquiry, controversial ANC-aligned North West businessman Brown Mogotsi made a series of claims before the Madlanga Commission on Tuesday, including that he was a Crime Intelligence agent and that KZN police commissioner Nhanhla Mkhwanazi works for the CIA.WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING

🇺🇸📂 Congress has finally voted near unanimously to force the release of the Epstein files. Donald Trump had opposed the release of files about the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein for months, only to about-face at the last minute.

🇺🇸👨‍⚖️ Meta has won a lawsuit seeking to unravel its acquisition of  Instagram and WhatsApp. The defeat of the antitrust case is a major setback for the US Federal Trade Commission antitrust crackdown started in Donald Trump’s first term.

🇺🇦🇪🇸 Spain has approved a €817-million aid package for Ukraine. In addition, US-provided military equipment will be purchased – by Spain – to a total of €100-million.

😚🐵A new published study has established that the first kiss was performed by early primates about 20 million years ago. Observations of various apes kissing suggest that we all shared one kissy ancestor, evolutionarily speaking.
