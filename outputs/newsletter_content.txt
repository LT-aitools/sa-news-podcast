We’re so sorry for the confusion.  Our story today on the National Arts Festival incorrectly stated that the festival would not be funded for 2026. In fact, it has yet to submit an application for the 2026/2027 year.

Minister of Sport, Arts and Culture Gayton McKenzie has indicated he wants to support new provincial festivals, which means funding for the annual flagship festival is not guaranteed.INSIDE GRASSROOTS YOUTH ACADEMY

The academy inspiring Khayelitsha youth

In 2004, pro boxer Jongi Kamko, a patient at Tygerberg Hospital in Cape Town, lay in bed with a swollen leg and an undiagnosed circulatory problem.He was then told that it might have to be amputated. He vowed that if he kept his leg, he would give everything back to boxing, the sport he loved and adored.

Kamko recovered without needing amputation. Despite never fighting professionally again, he kept his promise.“In the townships where we stay, young boys and girls have a lot of problems… I said to myself, let me take these kids and show them a way of dealing with life,” he says.

He became a coach, and founded the Grassroots Youth Academy in Makhaza, Khayelitsha, a multi-sport youth centre and gym offering boxing, cycling and academic tutoring. The academy was registered as a trust in 2006.

=== Zuma's authoritarian playbook expands - Sat, 08 Nov 2025 05:58 (SAST) ===

The sandwich, a symbol of defianceSaturday, 8 November 2025

John Stupart

“However, the regime’s propaganda forces paint Burkina Faso in a very different light. All appears well in the digitally-constructed alternate reality of President Ibrahim Traoré. In deepfake videos seen by millions worldwide, the country’s president is beloved by international stars such as Justin Bieber and Beyonce.”Raphael Parens

Zuma's despotic vacay

Analysis from Murmur Intelligence suggests a recent meeting between former president Jacob Zuma and Burkina Faso’s coup leader, Captain Ibrahim Traoré, is more than a symbolic photo-op. It represents the "public flowering" of an authoritarian narrative that has been quietly cultivated in South Africa.

Murmur Intelligence argues this event connects South Africa’s internal political grievances with a broader, continent-wide "authoritarian aspiration". The meeting, which also included Zuma's daughter Duduzile Zuma-Sambudla, is presented by Murmur Intelligence as a warning sign.This authoritarian sentiment is growing in the "fertile ground" of widespread public frustration.Murmur Intelligence points to an Afrobarometer survey showing a dramatic 21-point surge in three years, with 49% of South Africans now supporting military rule.For the first time, more citizens favor authoritarian rule than oppose it, a shift sharpest among the rural, poor, and unemployed.Murmur Intelligence states this disillusionment is being actively "weaponised" by several ideological currents simultaneously:

Religious nationalism mirroring U.S. MAGA narratives.Anti-foreigner and anti-crime populism that frames the rule of law as a "liberal inconvenience".Radical-left movements that openly venerate Traoré as a model for African liberation.

These domestic movements are supported by geopolitical actors, chief among them Russia, which uses "hybrid-warfare networks" to frame democracy as "Western decadence".This has created a "parallel media ecosystem" of digital-only news outlets and influencers that bypass traditional media. Murmur Intelligence warns that South Africa is approaching a "harvest phase," where these long-planted authoritarian seeds are maturing into mainstream political sentiment.

Essay | Sport keeps saving South Africa. We know politics won’t... yet?

While politicians chase power and score tenders, our sports stars chase runs and score goals. They consistently demonstrate the leadership qualities we desperately need. News24 deputy editor Ahmed Areff shares lessons that our political leaders can learn from our captains and coaches.

Interview | Lynn Phillips on living in a ‘criminal state’, and our ‘Holiday Inn’ prison myth

Lynn Phillips is the secretary of the Cape Flats Safety Forum and has been a community activist for over 30 years. What prompted her to get involved initially was “hunger, housing and health” but, as she tells Anneliese Burgess, she quickly realised these issues were symptoms of something much darker.

The online slip fake-news scammers use to steal your (or your business) identity

If you’ve ever let an old website domain lapse, you probably assumed it would fade quietly into the internet’s archives. Andrew Thompson explains that although domains can expire quietly, they don’t always disappear, and bad actors are increasingly using these for nefarious purposes.

Off-duty dining: Here’s where Salon’s head chef Carla Schulze eats out... and what she makes at home

Viv Vermaak is the bare-footed eccentric television host from Going Nowhere Slowly in the early 2000s, the iconic Sunday series that set the bar for South African travel shows. But she’s also a lot more than that, and sits down with Janine van der Post to talk about life lessons and the aberrant car in her garage.
