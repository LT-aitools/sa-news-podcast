The noxious nexus between politics, policing and criminality; whistleblowing as “an act of ubuntu”; and the crypto fraudsters behind a cloned News24’s website.

This week, News24 parliamentary journalist Jan Gerber writes that the testimonies before the Madlanga Commission and Parliament’s ad hoc committee expose the noxious nexus between politics, policing and criminality; Anneliese Burgess speaks to Johann van Loggerenberg, who has recently returned to SARS, about Nhlanhla Mkhwenazi’s allegations, whistleblowing as “and act of ubuntu”, and what GNU can learn from the Springboks; Rosetta Msimango spent three days shadowing and filming the passionate and dedicated rangers at the Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife Reserve; Janine van der Post chats to former Springbok scrumhalf Rudy Paige about his Golf that he pretends is a Ferrari; Noluthando Ngcakani asks top chef Mogau “The Lazy Makoti” Seshoene to share her favourite food-and-drink escapes; and Andrew Thompson exposes the fraudsters who have once again cloned News24’s website to promote a fake Trinity Capital crypto investment, this time using Good Things Guy founder and editor-in-chief Brent Lindeque’s name.
