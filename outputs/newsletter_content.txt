Maverick Sports 2025 ‌ ‌ ‌ Tuesday, 30 December 2025

Well, it was yet another memorable year for sports! Even as, from a local perspective, some administrators attempted to hog the spotlight with their misdeeds. Still, the athletes shone the brightest.

From the Proteas men winning the World Test Championship final against Australia, to the Proteas Women reaching yet another World Cup final, only to succumb to India in the 50-over World Cup decider. It was a heartbreaking third successive defeat for the team in a final.

The Springboks men once again did what they do best: win rugby matches and trophies. Rassie Erasmus’s men concluded a highly successful year by pummelling Wales 73-0. The Bok Women also conquered a major milestone in 2025 as they qualified for the knockout round of a World Cup for the first time in history back in August.

In soccer, Banyana Banyana had a year to forget as they only managed a fourth-placed finish in the Women’s Africa Cup of Nations. This after coming into the tournament as defending champions. Their male counterparts, Bafana Bafana, used 2025 to qualify for the Fifa World Cup for the first time since 2002. Although they played in 2010, it was merely as hosts.

Outside of the “big three” sports, there was ample athletics action with it being the World Athletics Championships. Although South Africa underperformed, their neighbours Botswana further enhanced their reputation as a rising track and field nation.

Further abroad and on two wheels Spaniard Marc Márquez won the MotoGP title for the first time since 2019, completing a remarkable comeback after battling with injuries in recent years. South Africa’s sole representative in MotoGP, Brad Binder, had a year to forget after finishing 11th overall.

On the Formula One circuit, pre-season favourite Lando Norris eventually lived up to the hype as he clinched his maiden world title in the premier division. But not before having to fend off a sustained challenge from McLaren teammate Oscar Piastri.

On the golf course, Rory McIlroy completed the career Grand Slam as he clinched his first-ever Masters’ title. On the tennis court, Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner further stoked their budding rivalry as they were involved in some highly entertaining clashes.

Overall, it was another exciting sports year, stacked with a number of beautiful stories that the Maverick Sports team told in myriad unique ways. In 2026, we will once again have our finger on the sports pulse, covering as many stories as possible despite being a small team of three full-time journalists.
