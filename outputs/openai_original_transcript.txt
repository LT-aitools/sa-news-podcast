Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is twenty six November two thousand twenty five. Here are the headlines we will cover: allegations that prominent figures lured young South Africans to fight in Russia and Ukraine, the arrest of a Gauteng High Court judge in an alleged corruption probe, a high-profile tenderpreneur’s bid to delay testimony while in prison, and fresh scrutiny of the Police Political Killings Task Team and its costs.

First up: allegations that South African men were recruited to fight in Russia and Ukraine. Multiple outlets report families and authorities are following disturbing claims that young men were lured to Russia under the promise of education or training and then sent into combat. One detailed account describes a nineteen-year-old from Botswana and his twenty-year-old cousin being told by a recruiter they would attend an educational programme; their families, however, have had no contact with them for three months as the pair were reportedly deployed on a combat mission. News organisations have identified Duduzile Zuma-Sambudla, daughter of former president Jacob Zuma, as a central figure in the recruitment allegations. She has been accused of organising or facilitating travel and training arrangements, and according to reporting she reportedly blamed another recruiter for some of the arrangements. The National Hawks are reported to be investigating claims that seventeen men were manipulated to assist the Russian army. This story has also drawn commentary and calls for clarification from senior political sources. Families remain desperate for information and some now say sons are missing in the Donbas region. We will update this bulletin as further verified details emerge.

In legal news: a Gauteng High Court judge has been arrested amid allegations of corruption. Reports identify the arrested judge as Portia Phahlane. The arrest is linked to an alleged bribery scheme during proceedings over a succession battle at the International Pentecost Holiness Church. Two men, Michael Sandlana and Vusi Ndala, are reported to have been arrested alongside the judge and are accused of paying kickbacks. Authorities say the probe concerns decisions made in that high-profile church case. At this stage these are allegations and matter to lawful processes; the arrests underline continued attention on corruption within both religious and judicial spheres. We will follow court updates and any official statements from judicial oversight bodies as they are published.

Now to parliamentary and prison business: Vusimuzi Matlala, widely known as Cat Matlala, has asked for a postponement of his testimony before an ad hoc parliamentary committee. Matlala is in custody at Kgosi Mampuru C-Max Prison in Pretoria, and his lawyers argue that imprisonment and his current condition are affecting his ability to understand the charges and prepare evidence. The committee has scheduled his appearance but Matlala sought a delay, citing his mental state and lack of preparation time. Correctional services officials say heightened security measures have been put in place for his planned testimony. Parliament’s ad hoc committee and related oversight structures will determine whether the hearing is postponed. Separately, media reports indicate that despite an attempted postponement, at least one news outlet expects Matlala to appear before the committee, and legal teams are preparing arguments on both sides.

Turning to policing and public finance: the South African Police Service chief financial officer has expressed shock after an internal note attributed to her was used to justify disbanding the Political Killings Task Team, or PKTT. The matter has ignited a furious exchange at parliamentary hearings. Officials told a parliamentary ad hoc committee that the PKTT has cost taxpayers four hundred thirty-five million rand since two thousand eighteen. The police finance boss has argued that irregular expenditure has not been taken seriously and warned of systemic problems. Opposition and committee members have questioned the transparency of spending and the decision-making that led to the PKTT review and partial disbandment. The debate comes at a time when South Africans are watching governance of security agencies closely, and Parliament has indicated it will pursue clarity, including whether internal notes and financial records were used appropriately.

A brief note on accountability in state entities: Parliament is also pressing the former Road Accident Fund chief executive, Collins Letsoalo, to appear before the standing committee on public accounts after receiving another summons. Committees have warned of possible action if he continues to decline attendance. This follows a wider pattern of public hearings where former and current executives are being asked to explain financial and governance decisions.
