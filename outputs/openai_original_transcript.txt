Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Thursday, the first of January, two thousand twenty six.

First up: Cape Town’s growing sewage crisis. The city has put a price on a long term solution, estimating the work required at twelve billion rand. Officials say this is the figure needed to address recurring failures in the wastewater system and to prevent further sewage discharges into the marine environment. The issue has already prompted public outcry and political debate, with opposition parties and civic groups warning that the environmental and health impacts are serious and ongoing. There is also pushback over plans to expand a marine sewage outfall, with critics saying that long term fixes must prioritise treatment capacity and infrastructure resilience rather than shifting the problem offshore. The cost provided by the city highlights the scale of the challenge ahead as residents head into the new year.

In national politics: President Cyril Ramaphosa used his New Year message to urge unity and offer a reminder of priorities for two thousand twenty six. He called for national cohesion as the country crosses into the new year and reflected on the progress of two thousand twenty five while acknowledging persistent challenges such as unemployment and crime. The president also reaffirmed a commitment to rooting out corruption, describing that fight as an overriding priority for government in the year ahead. His message aimed to strike a balance between acknowledging hard realities and encouraging hope, calling on South Africans to work together as the administration pursues accountability measures and service delivery improvements.

On border security and migration: the South African National Defence Force intercepted a large group of undocumented foreign nationals in Limpopo. Military personnel apprehended one thousand one hundred seventy four Zimbabwean nationals attempting to enter the country through illegal crossings. The operation, described as tense in some reports, formed part of a wider enforcement effort during the festive season; other agencies have reported thousands more undocumented migrants intercepted nationally over the period. The interceptions have raised questions about border management, the humanitarian treatment of migrants and the coordination between defence, policing and immigration authorities as South Africa responds to continued cross border movements.

Turning to a developing police matter and public concern: Eastern Cape police have opened an investigation after a shocking viral video showed children allegedly drinking alcohol. Authorities say a criminal case has been opened and investigators have traced parents believed to have supplied alcohol to minors during an incident on Christmas Day in the Santini location. The provincial police noted that the matter is being taken seriously and that the inquiry will look at both the adults involved and the welfare needs of the children. The viral footage has triggered wider public debate on child protection and parental responsibility over the festive season.

In local tragedy and road safety: nine people have died in a crash in the Eastern Cape. Reports from emergency services and local media said the collision left multiple people dead and several others injured. Authorities are investigating the circumstances of the crash as the community and emergency responders cope with the immediate aftermath. Road safety concerns repeatedly surface during peak travel times on our highways, and this latest incident is a grim reminder of the continuing toll of serious collisions on South African roads.

And finally a health update from the entertainment world: award winning musician Makhadzi was hospitalised following a car crash while travelling from Limpopo to Johannesburg. Multiple reports say she is in hospital and in a stable condition. Details on the cause of the collision and a full medical update remain limited as family and management continue to monitor her recovery. The news prompted a wave of messages from fans and colleagues wishing her a full and speedy recovery.
