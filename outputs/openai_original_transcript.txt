Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is nineteenth of December, two thousand and twenty five.

First up: a high-profile murder investigation in Johannesburg. Police say three suspects may have approached Warrick Stock, also known as DJ Warras, when he was shot a few days ago. Authorities are probing the killing amid reports that Stock had recently applied for a protection order tied to a hijacked building. The investigation is ongoing and police are focusing on possible links between the protection order and the motive for the attack. Gauteng political leaders have reacted, urging better protection for people who seek legal remedies. The case has also prompted calls from some quarters for stronger action against building hijackings and related criminality. Memorial events and further policing updates are expected as the probe continues.

Next: diplomatic tensions after South Africa detained foreign nationals connected to a US refugee programme, prompting a stern warning from Washington. The United States has threatened what it calls "severe consequences" following South Africa's deportation of Kenyan nationals, and has accused South African authorities of harassing United States government staff engaged in humanitarian work. Pretoria rejects those claims. The Department of International Relations and Cooperation has begun diplomatic talks with both the United States and Kenya over arrests linked to the refugee scheme. South African officials say they are in discussions to clarify the circumstances. The row has escalated quickly and remains fluid as DIRCO engages with its counterparts to resolve outstanding issues.

In education news: Gauteng faces a worsening school admissions crisis ahead of the start of the two thousand and twenty six academic year. Reports say more than ten thousand Grade One and Grade Eight learners remain unplaced amid persistent problems with the online admissions system. Parents and civil groups have expressed alarm and frustration, pointing to technical glitches, poor communication and unwanted transfers that have stretched confidence in the process. Calls are increasing for an urgent overhaul of admissions management, and political parties and civil organisations have demanded clearer plans and immediate fixes so that children are not left without schools when classes begin in January.

Turning to the criminal justice system: legal experts have criticised the National Director of Public Prosecutions, Shamila Batohi, following her abrupt exit from the Nkabinde inquiry. Observers warn the walkout raises accountability questions and leaves parts of the investigation in doubt. Reports note that the sudden departure has stirred debate about the inquiry's future and whether it will affect efforts to resolve allegations connected to the matter under investigation. The development has drawn coverage across the legal and political media, with commentators calling for clarity on the reasons for the exit and on how the NPA will proceed to ensure public confidence in the process.

Weather and public health updates now. The South African Weather Service is forecasting more rain on Christmas Day and into the New Year, and has issued warnings for several provinces. Authorities and meteorologists say a wet season pattern is likely to persist into late summer across much of the country, increasing risks of heavy downpours and localized flooding in vulnerable areas. At the same time, health authorities in the Western Cape and the National Institute for Communicable Diseases are urging parents to keep children up to date with measles vaccinations. The NICD has released its weekly measles and rubella situation report, while the Western Cape health department has renewed calls for immunisation as cases climb. Officials are stressing that vaccines are the most effective protection as the festive season places additional pressure on health services.

A brief governance note: the Presidency has received the interim report from the Madlanga commission, which is probing allegations of criminality and political interference in the justice system. The report was delivered to President Cyril Ramaphosa, and its findings have been the subject of media coverage and parliamentary interest. Observers say the reception of the interim report marks an important step in a process that seeks to restore confidence in key justice institutions.

And finally, a public spending story: Cabinet minister Maropene Ramokgopa travelled to New York in official capacity, with reporting indicating the journey cost nearly two million rand when accounting for expenses for both the minister and accompanying officials. The trip has generated questions in the media about travel expenditure and the use of public funds, prompting calls for transparency and scrutiny of official travel budgets.
