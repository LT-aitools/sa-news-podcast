Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Tuesday, the sixteenth of December, two thousand and twenty-five.

First up: the Madlanga commission. President Cyril Ramaphosa has approved that the commission pursue criminal referrals immediately, even as the interim report is being kept private. The Presidency says the interim findings will not be released to the public to protect witnesses, but it also signalled that where the commission identifies potentially criminal conduct, it is “quite keen” that those matters be referred straight away. The decision to withhold the interim report has prompted public debate and questions about transparency. News outlets report the Presidency is defending that choice as necessary for the integrity of ongoing probes, while the commission continues its work ahead of a final report that the President has said will be released in due course.

In governance and telecoms: a storm over Starlink and government directives. Communications Minister Solly Malatsi moved to direct the telecoms regulator to amend rules in a way that would bypass Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment requirements for a Starlink-style investor. That manoeuvre has sparked controversy and prompted officials to stress regulatory independence. The Presidency has emphasised that the regulator, ICASA, remains independent, even as discussions continue about how to accommodate foreign ICT investors. Critics warn that bypassing BEE rules could undermine South Africa’s equity policies and raise questions about digital sovereignty. This remains an unfolding policy debate between the executive, the regulator and stakeholders in the telecoms sector.

Next: developments in the National Prosecuting Authority testimony at an inquiry. National Director of Public Prosecutions Shamila Batohi dramatically refused to continue testifying at the inquiry into the fitness of the South Gauteng Director of Public Prosecutions, Andrew Chauke. Batohi said she needed proper legal counsel and walked out of the proceedings, leaving testimony disrupted and the inquiry’s schedule in question. The walkout sparked intense coverage and debate about the inquiry process. Media reports note heated exchanges and legal wrangling, with commentators asking why the NPA head absconded from testimony and what that means for the inquiry’s credibility and timeline.

Provincial politics in KwaZulu-Natal remains tense. The MK Party tabled a motion of no confidence against Premier Thami Ntuli in the provincial legislature but failed to remove him. The bid descended into chaos: MPLs banged tables, scuffled with police, and sang liberation songs while the session was disrupted for more than an hour. One MK Party member collapsed amid the scuffle. The legislature ultimately voted against the motion. The episode underlines ongoing volatility in the provincial chamber and the deep political fault lines that remain in KwaZulu-Natal politics.

In consumer and financial news: the National Financial Ombud Scheme’s banking division has recovered more than sixty million rand for consumers in twenty twenty-five. The ombud’s office returned that money after handling complaints and warned that consumers who misrepresent themselves when taking out loans or accessing credit cannot later claim reckless lending. The banking division’s recoveries signal a spike in complaints and reflect the ombud’s role in resolving disputes and clawing back funds for affected customers. Regulators and consumer advocates say this is a reminder that both lenders and borrowers must act responsibly in the credit market.

And a brief crime report from the Western Cape: a Cape Town off-duty law enforcement officer was killed while assisting at an accident scene after an allegedly drunk driver crashed into the scene. Coverage describes the tragedy as a stark reminder of road-safety risks during the festive season and the lethal consequences of driving under the influence. The incident has increased calls for tougher enforcement and community vigilance as holiday traffic intensifies.

Finally, a quick note on law enforcement oversight: the funeral arrangements for Marius “Vlam” van der Merwe, a witness connected to the Madlanga commission who was shot dead in his driveway, are set to proceed this week. His killing has renewed concerns about the safety of witnesses in high-profile corruption and law-enforcement probes and feeds into the broader debate over how to protect those involved in sensitive inquiries.

That is the Mzansi Lowdown for today. That is all for today,
