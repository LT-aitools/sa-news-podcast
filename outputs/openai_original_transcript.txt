First up: new evidence at the Madlanga Commission is deepening the controversy around suspended deputy national police commissioner Shadrack Sibiya. Crime Intelligence head Dumisani Khumalo has told the commission that video and photographs point to links between Sibiya and organised crime figures. Khumalo says Sibiya allegedly used a sergeant to collect bribe money from cartel bosses and that a convicted carjacker supplied the bakkie Sibiya used — the same man reportedly acted as a protective presence when Sibiya testified before Parliament. These revelations form part of broader evidence, Khumalo says, that suggests cartel infiltration inside the South African Police Service and raises questions about leadership and integrity in the force. Sibiya has denied wrongdoing and is seeking an opportunity to cross-examine witnesses at related inquiries, but the commission hearings are continuing and investigators are pressing what they describe as troubling links between senior police and criminal networks.

In another high-profile policing matter, investigators are following up after an attack on businessman Brown Mogotsi. Mogotsi’s vehicle was sprayed with bullets and eyewitness accounts are under scrutiny after a witness told reporters that a man got out of a car and started firing. Police confirmed the incident involved Mogotsi’s vehicle and say he has not yet presented himself to make a formal statement. Authorities are waiting for him to come forward so they can take his version of events as part of their ongoing enquiries into allegations that have previously connected Mogotsi to controversial political and criminal networks. The story remains fluid as police collect evidence at the scene and continue interviews.

In governance and elections news, President Cyril Ramaphosa has reappointed Mosotho Moepya and Mangila Pillay to the Independent Electoral Commission for another term. The appointments come as the IEC prepares for the critical local government elections next year. The Economic Freedom Fighters have voiced strong discomfort with the move, saying they are “deeply disturbed” by the reappointments. The shake-up at the IEC follows a wider period of debate about electoral readiness, technology choices, and the first Wednesday of November being targeted as the likely date for the 2026 poll. With more than four hundred parties expected to contest, the composition and perceived independence of the commission will remain a central issue for parties and voters.

In economic headlines: South Africans will welcome softer fuel prices this month. Official adjustments announced this week confirm cuts to petrol from midnight, driven by a stronger rand and lower oil prices. Reports say petrol will drop by fifty-one cents a litre in the November cycle, a relief for motorists after months of pressure on household budgets. The rand itself has been described as swinging “from zero to hero” after recent gains, bringing some breathing space for imported fuel costs. While this is immediate relief at the pumps, analysts caution that currency and global oil volatility will continue to influence prices going forward.

On the transformation and business front, government is revising plans for a big new empowerment fund. The Department of Trade, Industry and Competition has produced a refreshed concept document for a one hundred billion rand Transformation Fund. The updated version aims to be more attractive to companies and addresses governance, access to capability and how contributions could translate into enterprise and supplier development scorecard points. The adjustments are intended to broaden participation by allowing firms to earn compliance credit through meaningful contributions to the fund, while trying to fix problems that dogged earlier iterations of the proposal.

And finally, a positive community story from the Western Cape. In the Franschhoek winelands, entrepreneur Jocelyn van der Ross is building a growing recycling business called Green Spot Trading. What started small has expanded into a trusted municipal partner with operations now reaching Paarl. With new vehicles, proper protective equipment and a growing team, van der Ross has created seven jobs in four years and now employs forty-four people. Her model shows how targeted support for women-led enterprises can turn waste into steady livelihoods and help strengthen local recycling systems.
