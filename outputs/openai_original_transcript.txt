Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is the fifteenth of November, two thousand twenty-five.

First up: a government probe after a planeload of Palestinian travellers landed at OR Tambo International Airport and were ultimately allowed into the country. Authorities said one hundred and fifty-three Palestinian citizens arrived in Johannesburg and were initially denied entry for failing to meet immigration requirements. The group was later permitted to disembark on ninety-day visas and is being hosted by Gift of the Givers, according to reports. The Palestinian embassy in Pretoria has told citizens to beware of unregistered intermediaries, saying an “unregistered and misleading” organisation arranged the trip and that families were charged to facilitate travel. President Cyril Ramaphosa has said the passengers appear to have been “flushed out” and the government’s security cluster will investigate the circumstances of the arrival. Home Affairs has opened inquiries while civil society and media question how a large group arrived without the usual paperwork and how immigration controls were negotiated. We will keep watching developments as the inquiry proceeds.

In city and summit news: Johannesburg is in G20 final-prep mode with heavy visible preparations across Sandton and central districts. The summit will be hosted here next week, the first G20 leaders meeting on African soil, and city officials have been repairing streets, repainting signage and running joint operations to tidy the precinct. But the clean-up has a human cost. Reports say the City of Johannesburg has been clearing some inner-city homeless people from public spaces in the run-up to the summit. Daily Maverick coverage notes people are being removed from streets without a clear plan for where they should go, and advocates and observers describe the moves as disruptive and leaving vulnerable residents in limbo. There is also international attention on who will attend: several world leaders are opting out, and questions remain about invitations. Locally, traffic and security plans are being rolled out, and authorities warn of temporary restrictions and disruptions during the summit. The optics are stark: a city polishing itself for visiting delegations while civil society calls for a more humane approach to homelessness and social services.

Turning to governance and accountability: the Auditor-General has taken a landmark step against procurement corruption at municipal level. The accounting officer and municipal manager of a North West district municipality have been ordered to personally repay four million six hundred thousand rand after an inflated water tender caused losses. This is the first time a certificate of debt has been issued in such a case, making the official personally liable for the shortfall. The move follows the Auditor-General’s findings into irregular spending and is being framed as a signal that there will be direct consequences for officials who preside over mismanagement. Reaction from civic groups and opposition politicians has stressed the need for stronger deterrents, while municipal finance watchers say enforcement will be critical if similar recoveries are to take place elsewhere.

In provincial politics: Gauteng premier Panyaza Lesufi has survived a motion of no confidence in the provincial legislature. The Democratic Alliance tabled the motion, but the majority of parties in the legislature voted against it, allowing Lesufi to retain his post. The motion followed months of political scrutiny and criticism of regional governance, yet opposition members ultimately refused to back removal. Lesufi’s survival will matter for upcoming city and provincial priorities, including preparations for the G20. Political observers say the vote reinforces the current coalition arithmetic in Gauteng, but tensions within and between parties remain visible in public debates and media coverage.

Finally, a lighter note and a national honour: acclaimed actor and playwright Dr John Kani has been awarded the WWF Living Planet Award for an Individual by WWF South Africa. Kani accepted the honour at the organisation’s fifty-seventh annual general meeting and Living Planet Awards. The recognition celebrates his contributions and stands out as a reminder of positively framed national stories amid heavier headlines. The award underlines the ongoing role of artists and public figures in championing environmental and social causes across the country.

A few brief headlines: the national Treasury and finance commentators continue to debate the medium-term budget outlook as policymakers and business lobby for measures to spur growth. In education, the Eastern Cape has had a large grant withheld over unauthorised information and communications technology spending, with five hundred twenty-nine million rand affected while the department sorts the issue. And the Madlanga Commission of Inquiry into alleged political interference and criminal justice failings continues to generate intense public scrutiny, with testimony and social media conversation keeping the matter in the spotlight.

That is it for today.
