Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Sunday, the fourteenth of December, twenty twenty five.

First up: search and rescue efforts continue after a deadly building collapse near Durban. Authorities in KwaZulu‑Natal are at the scene of a temple collapse in Redcliffe, north of Durban, where emergency teams have been working through rubble. Reports say at least four bodies have been recovered and rescuers have spotted a fifth person, while others were injured. The Public Works Minister is set to visit the site as teams continue their search. The incident has prompted calls for answers and for ministers to seek reasons for the collapse as families and neighbours await further information. That is the latest from multiple local outlets covering the Verulam and Redcliffe area.

In other hard news from communities: backyard and illegal mining in Bapong is deepening a local crisis. Investigations and eyewitness reports describe hunger, fear and a breakdown of safety in the area as residents confront rampant illegal mining activity on their doorsteps. Coverage highlights the human toll — communities living with constant risk, intimidation and insecurity as miners operate in close proximity to homes. Broadcasters and newspapers are painting a picture of neighbourhoods living in fear, and community members are urging faster intervention from law enforcement and municipal authorities to restore order and protect vulnerable families.

In national policy news: the Department of Home Affairs has proposed tighter rules on asylum and a shift toward a merit‑based system for citizenship. Officials say the measures are intended to strengthen controls over immigration and to introduce criteria that would make citizenship applications dependent on specific merit factors, according to reporting. The proposal has been presented publicly and picked up by national outlets; it signals a push to change how South Africa processes asylum claims and awards citizenship, although details and next steps will determine how fast and how broadly any reforms might be implemented.

Political and regulatory tensions are elsewhere in the executive: a new government gazette issued by the communications minister — referenced in coverage this weekend — has triggered concern inside the ruling party and across opposition benches. The ANC has flagged the gazette as presenting a “serious risk,” with critics warning it could bypass established regulatory processes and Parliament. The directive has also been tied to efforts to clear the way for satellite operators, including Starlink, to operate in South Africa, after relaxation of ownership rules earlier this year. Political parties and industry observers are calling the move unlawful or at least highly contestable, saying it raises questions about due process and proper oversight in communications regulation.

Turning to municipal services and public finances: a new report on Johannesburg’s electricity utility, City Power, paints a bleak picture. The company that keeps Johannesburg’s lights on is reportedly crippled by debt and crime, said the analysis. City Power is said to be about twenty billion rand in the red, spending at least two billion rand more than it collects in revenue, while losing at least forty two percent of the electricity it purchases from Eskom — losses attributed largely to theft and vandalism. The findings underline urgent calls for reform as the city faces mounting financial strain and service delivery challenges.

A couple of legal and high‑profile stories making headlines: the legal dispute over Thuli Madonsela’s estate involving ten million rand has taken a new turn, according to reporting this morning. Details are emerging about fresh developments in the case, though sources simply note a “new twist” in the ongoing legal battle. Separately, former Gauteng politician Edwin Sodi is in the spotlight over alleged lavish spending: coverage reports a Louis Vuitton shopping spree of four hundred thousand rand that could lead to court action and the potential auctioning of assets as investigators and courts move to recover funds.

And briefly in business and safety: Cape Town is preparing to build a one hundred and eighty million rand security wall along the N2 in the airport area to try to curb smash‑and‑grab attacks after recent violent crimes, and the Road Accident Fund is under scrutiny for an expensive call‑centre deal that appears to have cost the agency far more than internal alternatives. Both stories underline continuing concerns about public safety and oversight of public funds as the holiday season ramps up.
