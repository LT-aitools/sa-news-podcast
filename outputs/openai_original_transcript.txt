Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is the fourth of December, two thousand and twenty-five.

First up: a troubling recruitment scandal that has left families desperate. News24 reporting has confirmed that the MK Party was invoiced for at least one of the flights that took South African men to Russia, where they were allegedly duped into joining combat operations rather than receiving the promised bodyguard training. The invoice for one man’s ticket was for twenty thousand two hundred forty-five rand. Seventeen men remain stuck in that conflict, and WhatsApp messages published by investigators suggest plans for further groups and requests for repayments. The story has widened to include allegations that public figures were involved in arranging travel, and families remain urgently concerned for the safety of their loved ones. News organisations are continuing to track the legal and political fallout as questions mount over who organised the trips and who will be held accountable.

In national accountability news: testimony continued at the Madlanga Commission of Inquiry this week as suspended Ekurhuleni metro police deputy chief Julius Mkhwanazi took the witness stand. Multiple reports describe a tense and uncomfortable appearance, with Mkhwanazi denying key allegations. He rejected claims that he fitted blue lights to vehicles linked to accused businessman Vusimuzi "Cat" Matlala and said that offers of free security to the city were made amid concerns for safety. His demeanour in the witness box was described as jittery, and the commission is probing a range of serious allegations that include possible interference in investigations and other conduct unbecoming of a senior official. The inquiry’s proceedings are likely to have broader implications for municipal oversight and for how irregular relationships between officials and private security providers are handled.

In governance and public finances: the Auditor-General’s scrutiny of student funding and NSFAS operations has stirred fresh concern. The Sunday Times reports the Auditor-General found that NSFAS books are disorganised and that financials have been misrepresented, with the fund recording a loss of eighty-four million rand in its latest accounts. At the same time, law-enforcement activity has followed allegations of fraud in student funding. A twenty-four-year-old former student representative council member from Rustenburg TVET College was arrested by the Hawks on allegations relating to NSFAS students. These developments underline persistent challenges in the administration of student support and the risk that mismanagement and alleged fraud will undermine access to higher education for vulnerable students.

On social services and inclusion: the Gauteng health department says it is accelerating support for people living with disabilities. TimesLive reports that more than forty-two thousand assistive devices have been issued in the first two quarters of the two thousand twenty-five to twenty-six financial year. Officials frame the push as part of an effort to make the province more inclusive and to ensure that assistive technology is available where it is needed. The scale of distribution suggests an increased focus on rehabilitation and independence, though delivery and follow-up will be key to measuring impact on the ground.
