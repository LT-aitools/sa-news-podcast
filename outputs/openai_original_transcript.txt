Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is fourteen November two thousand and twenty-five. Here are the main stories you need to know.

First up: a major development in the fight to shore up South Africa's media industry. The Competition Commission has released the final report of its media and digital platforms inquiry and, separately, Google has agreed to a settlement to pay South African news publishers. Google will pay six hundred and eighty-eight million rand over the next five years to local media houses, a move that follows the commission’s findings about dominant platforms and the squeeze on journalism. Analysts and industry bodies have greeted the settlement with cautious relief — the commission’s report has been described as a rope thrown to a beleaguered industry, but one that may not be sturdy enough on its own. Sanef, the South African National Editors' Forum, has welcomed the inquiry results, while commentators note the report offers scant hope unless it is backed by stronger measures and follow through. Expect ongoing debate about how the funds will be distributed, whether the remedies will change platform behaviour, and how small newsrooms will be protected in the long term.

In governance and corruption news, hearings at the Madlanga commission and parliamentary oversight are again spotlighting alleged protection within municipal and police structures. Testimony and investigative reporting paint a picture of a tenderpreneurial network linked to Vusimusi "Cat" Matlala and an embattled metro police boss, Brigadier Julius Mkhwanazi. Matlala has been tied to large public contracts, including a police health services tender reportedly worth three hundred and sixty million rand, and to security services provided to the Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Police Department. The Independent Police Investigative Directorate found strong indications of fraud and corruption connected to Mkhwanazi. Former Ekurhuleni officials testified that those findings were met with what a commissioner called a "nonsense" document from the city, and witnesses allege disciplinary processes were halted and some officials were rewarded. One former HR manager said senior staff received what he described as a six hundred thousand rand "reward" after stopping hearings into Mkhwanazi. Parliament has also heard heated exchanges: Cedrick Nkabinde, the suspended police minister’s chief of staff, faced accusations of giving contradictory testimony and was accused by some MPs of perjury after admitting parts of his evidence were uncertain. These proceedings are shaping up to be a key test of accountability in municipal and police procurement and disciplinary systems.

Now to a developing humanitarian and immigration story at OR Tambo International. Around one hundred and sixty Palestinian refugees who were on a flight bound for South Africa were finally allowed to disembark after a prolonged ordeal on the tarmac. Passengers and aid groups reported that disembarkation took more than twelve hours, and relief organisations such as Gift of the Givers have stepped in to accommodate arrivals. South Africa’s handling of the situation has drawn attention from civil society and the broader public, and it arrives against a background of heightened international focus on Gaza. Authorities are working with humanitarian partners to process arrivals and provide shelter and care for the families who made the journey.

In municipal and environmental accountability: the Mpumalanga High Court has imposed a hefty penalty on Emalahleni Local Municipality. The court fined the municipality six hundred and fifty million rand for allowing untreated sewage to flow into rivers and dams over years. Of that amount, one hundred and fifty million rand was suspended. The ruling follows prosecutions and environmental action over repeated contraventions of the National Water Act and the National Environmental Management Act. The fine is one of the largest to date in environmental litigation against a local authority and underscores growing judicial intolerance of municipal mismanagement that harms water resources and communities.

On a lighter note for the Cape Town coastline: the Two Oceans Aquarium is celebrating its thirtieth birthday. The aquarium has been a fixture for locals and visitors, known for its glass tunnels and immersive exhibits. Over three decades it has positioned itself as much more than an attraction: it has focused on ocean education, conservation work, and community connection. Staff and supporters point to the institution’s role in helping people notice and care for the ocean, and today the facility marks thirty years of public programmes and conservation partnerships that aim to raise awareness about marine ecosystems and their importance to South Africa’s future.

A quick wrap. Those are the main headlines shaping the day: the Competition Commission’s findings and Google’s six hundred and eighty-eight million rand settlement for media houses; fresh testimony and allegations of protection for implicated officials in Ekurhuleni and at the police; the long-delayed disembarkation of Palestinian arrivals at OR Tambo; a landmark environmental fine for Emalahleni; and the Two Oceans Aquarium marking thirty years of ocean education and conservation.

That is all for today.
