Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is twenty first of November, two thousand and twenty five.

First up: a diplomatic standoff at the G20. President Cyril Ramaphosa has made it clear he will not hand over South Africa’s G20 presidency to a United States chargé d’affaires. The US initially signalled it would not attend the Johannesburg summit, then sought to participate at the handover. Pretoria has rejected the idea that a junior official should accept the presidency in place of a full US delegation. The White House has pushed back, saying Washington is only resuming a limited role, and tensions remain over whether the US will engage beyond a ceremonial handover. The row has underscored a broader friction between the two capitals in the run up to the summit, with both sides publicly sparring about representation and the summit’s outcomes.

In political accountability and oversight: the Madlanga Commission continues to make headlines. Brown Mogotsi, a controversial witness in the inquiry, has faced sharp criticism and a gruelling cross-examination. He has admitted to lying under oath in previous testimony and has been described by the commission’s chief evidence leader as a “professional liar.” Questions about Mogotsi’s credibility have led him to ask whether it is still worth him testifying, after prosecutors and commissioners repeatedly challenged his statements, including claims about advance knowledge of the disbandment of the police unit known as the PKTT. The fallout has reignited scrutiny of evidence in the commission and the political questions that have shadowed long-running probes into security and intelligence matters.

On another headline tied to allegations of recruitment and foreign conflict, reporting has emerged about a group of South African men trapped in Russia and coerced into fighting in Ukraine. Coverage shows they were allegedly recruited through promises of training for VIP protection and then pressed into combat, with phones confiscated and bank accounts reportedly drained. WhatsApp group messages have implicated Duduzile Zuma-Sambudla in administering a recruitment group called “MK slash Russia Mission.” Families have said they feel betrayed and intend to lay charges. The situation remains a developing story with serious legal and diplomatic implications for those involved.

In economic news: the South African Reserve Bank has cut the repurchase rate by twenty-five basis points, bringing the main rate to six point seven five percent. Governor Lesetja Kganyago said the bank will operate with a new inflation target and signalled the objective of returning inflation toward three percent over time. The move is the first rate cut since July and follows a series of easing steps that have reduced borrowing costs since September last year. The bank also warned that recent rand strength may be temporary, reflecting ongoing concerns in the monetary policy committee about the durability of exchange rate improvements and inflation outlooks. The rate cut will bring some relief to cash-strapped households and borrowers, but policymakers emphasised cautious monitoring of inflation risks.

Turning to policing and procurement: the awarding of a three hundred and sixty million rand SAPS health tender to Vusimuzi “Cat” Matlala’s company remains under intense scrutiny. Testimony before parliament’s ad hoc committee has revealed that the police supply chain did not run proper vetting checks on the company before the award was made. The SAPS divisional commissioner responsible for supply chain management conceded this point in hearings. Internal audit reports and parliamentary hearings have flagged multiple red flags in the procurement process and questioned why a bid that showed irregularities was not disqualified. SAPS officials, including their supply chain head, have defended the award in public testimony, but critics say the explanations do not resolve the gaps in oversight.

On gender-based violence: President Ramaphosa has declared that South Africa is facing a gender-based violence crisis as activists prepare for a national shutdown. Women For Change and other groups have announced a nationwide shutdown for the twenty first of November, with organisers setting official meeting points in at least fifteen locations, including Sea Point Promenade in Cape Town. Civil society is demanding that government treat gender-based violence and femicide as a national disaster, and the president used recent international platforms to place the issue at the centre of South Africa’s social and economic agenda. Cultural figures and public personalities have shown solidarity through postponements and public statements ahead of the shutdown.

A final short item: parliamentary oversight matters continue to dominate the week, with high-profile hearings, questions over procurement, and renewed calls for accountability across institutions. The intersecting stories of the Madlanga Commission, procurement probes, and diplomatic tensions at the G20 will be centre stage as leaders and institutions converge in Johannesburg for the summit.

That is all for today.
