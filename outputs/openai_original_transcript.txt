Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is eight December two thousand and twenty five. Straight to the headlines.

First up: the murder of Madlanga Commission witness Marius van der Merwe, known in reports as Witness D, is dominating headlines and raising fresh concerns about the safety of people who testify in high-profile probes. His partner wrote, "I have lost my love; my children have lost their father and our country a hero," after he was killed. Security officials are publicly consistent about two possible motives: his recent testimony before the Madlanga Commission and his reported role in the removal of a camp from which illegal miners operated. Reports say CCTV footage shows the whistle-blower talking to his killers before he was murdered, and investigators note he had survived two previous assassination attempts.

The killing is reverberating across the state. President Cyril Ramaphosa warned that Witness D’s death will deter other witnesses from coming forward. The Justice Minister faced backlash for suggesting the media may have played a role by publicising that the victim was a commission witness, asking how the public knew his identity and implying leaks may have helped those who targeted him. Newspapers and commentators describe the murder as a blow to truth and accountability and say it expands a sinister web of kidnappings, threats and intimidation linked to police capture hearings. Police have opened investigations but, as of the latest reports, there have been no arrests.

In politics: the African National Congress National General Council has opened in Johannesburg and, as expected, questions about leadership and succession are front and centre. Delegates will meet through the week to review party performance and to debate renewal, including how to manage leadership succession. The agenda includes policy implementation, unpaid salaries in some municipalities, and broader issues like inequality and corruption. Analysts say change of top leadership is unlikely despite whispering campaigns, but the conference is being treated as a critical moment for the ANC to regain relevance and moral authority.

Inside the ANC, sources say leaders are moving to steady President Ramaphosa amid murmurings of removal and growing tensions over coalition partners. Commentators and party insiders frame the NGC as an attempt to reassure the president and to present a united front while grappling with the practical challenges of governance and rebuilding credibility. The Daily Maverick and other outlets frame this meeting as pivotal for whether the party can translate internal debate into coherent policy and effective leadership transition planning.

In governance and public administration: Home Affairs has revoked the ninety-day visa exemption for holders of ordinary Palestinian passports. The department says the decision follows a probe into alleged abuse of a charter-flight exemption and what it described as systematic exploitation of the visa-free period. Officials cited concerns about people arriving under the exemption and not complying with the intended terms; News24 and IOL report the revocation was prompted by evidence of organised efforts to exploit the exemption for longer stays. The change has sparked commentary about policy and principle: critics say the move will raise questions about South Africa’s stance on Palestinian travellers, while officials stress the need to protect the integrity of immigration processes.

In law and prosecutions: interviews to appoint the new head of the National Prosecuting Authority begin this week. The process includes several candidates and continues to attract controversy because one prominent applicant, Menzi Simelane, remains in contention despite public opposition. Freedom Under Law has formally opposed Simelane’s candidacy, and media reports say the matter will be scrutinised closely as the selection panel proceeds. The new director of public prosecutions will face a prosecution service still under pressure to rebuild public trust and to demonstrate independence in high-profile matters.

A local legal and medical controversy has also emerged in Stellenbosch. Dr Pieter Henning, a radiologist and co-founder of a private radiology firm, has been arrested after an incident in which he allegedly fired shots at a business premises while reportedly intoxicated. Separately, he faces allegations of opioid abuse — specifically pethidine — allegations he denies and calls an attempt to damage his reputation. Mediclinic says it will consider the matter internally, while the Health Professions Council of South Africa has confirmed impairment allegations will go before its health committee next month. The story has raised questions about practitioner impairment, employer responsibilities and professional oversight in health care.

Those are the main stories shaping South Africa today: the killing of a key Madlanga Commission witness and the broader threats facing whistle-blowers; the ANC’s National General Council and a tense discussion about leadership and renewal; the revocation of the ninety-day Palestinian visa exemption after alleged abuse; the start of NDPP interviews amid controversy over a leading candidate; and the arrest and professional probe of a Stellenbosch doctor. We will continue to follow these developments as they unfold.

That is all for today,
