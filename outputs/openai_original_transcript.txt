Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is eleven November two thousand and twenty five.

First up: the trial of Duduzile Zuma-Sambudla opened in Durban this week. Zuma-Sambudla, a member of parliament for the MK Party, pleaded not guilty as her high court hearing began. The State says her social media posts deliberately and unlawfully inflamed public unrest linked to the July two thousand and twenty one riots that killed hundreds and cost the economy billions of rand. Defence lawyers told the court they had concerns that the state had been spying on their client well before the unrest. The case will be closely watched for its evidentiary record and the broader questions it raises about political speech and accountability.

Next: developments from the Madlanga commission and related parliamentary oversight. MPs are preparing to travel to Kgosi Mampuru maximum security prison in Pretoria to hear oral evidence from Vusimuzi “Cat” Matlala, a key figure in probes into alleged corruption and wrongdoing linked to policing. Matlala has said he is eager to appear before the ad hoc committee, but the parliamentary process is running into logistical and security friction — reports say police have resisted aspects of the planned testimony. At the same time, the commission has heard dramatic allegations about rogue activity inside the Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Police Department, including claims of extortion, kidnapping, theft and torture. A whistleblower was reportedly murdered after exposing an unlawful operation, and CCTV evidence has tied an EMPD brigadier to an alleged copper-theft raid. Parliament’s effort to extract testimony from inside prisons underlines how difficult oversight has become when criminal probes, institutional reputations and political pressure intersect.

In other national security news with international consequences: family members say a group of South African men were sent to Russia by the MK Party for what they were told was bodyguard training, but they have since been stuck on the frontline of the war in Ukraine. The men are believed to be in the Donbas region and are reportedly being kept in poor conditions. In a letter that appears to bear Jacob Zuma’s signature, the former president pleads with the Russian defence minister to move the men to a safer location. Families describe the situation as a grave betrayal and have called for urgent consular and diplomatic action.

Turning to municipal finances: Johannesburg Water’s headline debt has surged again, this time topping one billion rand. The city admitted to overdue payments and blamed administrative delays, but water campaigners and critics have accused officials of “creative” accounting and warned that the financial squeeze threatens vital water infrastructure. The rising liability has prompted protests and renewed calls for transparency and ringfenced funding to keep water services running. Activists say the risk is not only financial; it is about the sustainability of basic services for millions of residents.

In national transport policy: the rollout of the Administrative Adjudication of Road Traffic Offences system, known as Aarto, has been postponed again. The transport minister has deferred the implementation to the first of July two thousand and twenty six, citing that municipalities are not prepared for the new road traffic regime. The repeated delays have political and practical consequences — municipalities, road-user groups and the private sector have been forced to recalibrate plans around demerit systems and enforcement timelines yet again.

A lighter note from the arts: South African flautist Khanyisile Mthetwa has been named a semifinalist in the Petrichor International Music Competition, placing her among top international artists and ensembles. Her debut album, titled African Bird, impressed the Petrichor jury with its blend of African identity, classical technique and social consciousness. Critics have called the record genre-defying and timeless, and the recognition underlines a string of recent successes for South African classical musicians on global stages.

Those are the headlines making news around the country this morning: a high-profile trial in Durban, dramatic hearings and testimony in the Madlanga inquiry, South Africans trapped in a foreign conflict after misleading recruitment, a growing water debt in Johannesburg, another Aarto postponement, and an international nod for a homegrown musician.

That is all for today,
