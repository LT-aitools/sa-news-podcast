Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is thirteen January two thousand and twenty-six. Here are the stories you need to know.

First up: matric results and what they reveal. Basic Education Minister Siviwe Gwarube has announced the National Senior Certificate results for the class of two thousand and twenty-five. Nationally, the pass rate reached eighty-eight percent — the highest on record. KwaZulu‑Natal stood out with a provincial pass rate of ninety point six percent, the top in the country. The Independent Examinations Board, the IEB, reported an overall pass rate of ninety‑eight point three one percent for its candidates.

At the same time, education experts are warning against oversimplifying the success. Several outlets and commentators note that behind the headline result there are worrying trends. Fewer learners are taking mathematics — only thirty‑four point one percent chose to write mathematics rather than mathematics literacy in twenty‑twenty‑five — and performance in gateway subjects is mixed. Opinion pieces in national papers and the editorial pages argue that stability in pass rates can sometimes mask deeper problems in the education system, such as uneven quality and persistent barriers to post‑school readiness.

Minister Gwarube also used the release to highlight the dedication of teachers, learners and parents, and she praised the top achievers for their perseverance. Differently abled learners were celebrated among the top achievers as well. As schools reopen this week, education officials and researchers say the work now shifts to consolidating gains, improving access to critical subjects, and addressing the longer‑term challenges of placement and quality across provinces.

In environmental and disaster news: firefighting crews continue to battle extensive wildfires in the Franschhoek and surrounding Cape Winelands areas. Fireline estimates put the affected line at more than fifty kilometres, with crews working to contain multiple fronts. Reports describe devastation across wine farms and rural properties, and local authorities and estate owners have been coordinating containment efforts.

Some coverage states that fires have mostly been contained in certain areas, while other reports say blazes remain active and power outages are affecting residents. Firefighters and ground crews have been praised for holding the line under difficult conditions. This remains a developing situation for communities in the Cape Winelands region as recovery and damage assessments begin.

Now a defence and diplomatic development involving South African waters. Iran has pulled out of the multinational naval exercise Will for Peace, which was due to include South Africa, China, Russia and the United Arab Emirates. Reports say Iranian warships were in False Bay but would not take part in the exercise amid political tensions. The decision leaves the South African‑hosted exercise proceeding without the Iranian vessels. This development follows reporting that three Iranian warships were waiting in False Bay, and their absence has been publicly noted by organisers and commentators tracking the multinational exercise.

The exercise and Iran’s withdrawal have drawn attention to regional naval cooperation and the complexities of hosting multinational military events. South African authorities and participating navies will continue with the exercise as planned, according to coverage.

In health sector news: Discovery Health has reversed a controversial billing position after a public uproar and regulatory scrutiny. The medical scheme administrator faced backlash when a systems error produced "you owe us" notices affecting sixteen thousand five hundred and seven members, with some demands reportedly climbing into tens of thousands of rand. After pressure from the Council for Medical Schemes and public criticism, Discovery Health pledged to absorb the mistake, promising refunds and to prevent benefit disruption for affected members in two thousand and twenty‑six.

Daily Maverick and other outlets have framed the episode as a governance and controls question for a major health administrator, saying the regulator probe and public response spared members from financial harm. The incident has prompted broader questions about oversight, systems resilience, and accountability in private medical schemes.

Finally, a political shift inside a minor but newsworthy party. The MK Party announced internal leadership changes, appointing Brian Molefe as its new treasurer‑general and removing Colleen Makhubele as parliamentary chief whip. The party said it relieved its former treasurer of duties with immediate effect and that the decision followed a directive from its national officials. The move continues a pattern of rapid personnel changes within the party and has drawn attention because Brian Molefe is a high‑profile figure with a controversial public profile. Colleen Makhubele will remain a member of parliament despite being relieved as chief whip.

That is the round of stories for this morning: top matric results with underlying concerns about subject uptake and readiness for post‑school options; fierce fires in the Franschhoek and Cape Winelands area; Iran pulling out of the False Bay naval exercise; Discovery Health reversing a large billing error affecting over sixteen thousand members; and leadership changes inside the MK Party.

That is all for today,
