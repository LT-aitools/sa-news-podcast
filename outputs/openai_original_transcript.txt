Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Thursday, the sixth of November, two thousand and twenty-five.

First up: politics and the Western Cape. The province is seeing a fresh wave of defections that could reshape next year’s elections. Former ANC Western Cape provincial secretary Neville Delport is among senior figures who have resigned from the ANC and joined the Democratic Alliance. News outlets report the move follows a reconfiguration of the ANC’s provincial executive, and party insiders say the switch signals deeper instability inside the provincial ANC. The DA is framing these defections as a net gain as it seeks to strengthen its position ahead of the two thousand and twenty-six polls. Analysts quoted in the coverage warn this is symptomatic of growing leadership struggles and factionalism within the ANC in the province.

Next: policing and parliamentary scrutiny. Acting Police Minister Firoz Cachalia has returned to Parliament to testify before an ad hoc committee probing allegations of corruption and mismanagement in the criminal justice system. In testimony covered widely today, Cachalia called the disbandment of the Scorpions, the corruption-busting unit dissolved in two thousand and nine, a mistake and said current problems prove that decision was wrong. He also addressed specific concerns about KwaZulu-Natal police commissioner Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi, saying the former July press briefing in which Mkhwanazi appeared in military or Special Task Force-style regalia “worried” him and conjured up images of a coup. Cachalia told MPs he had difficulties understanding the decision by suspended minister Senzo Mchunu to disband the Political Killings Task Team, and he defended giving duties to his deputies to ensure the police ministry functions with more than one person at the helm.

In crime and high-profile investigations: police have executed search and seizure warrants linked to controversial businessman Brown Mogotsi. Authorities say devices were seized as part of ongoing probes. Mogotsi is also reported to be meeting police with his lawyers over an alleged assassination attempt; eyewitnesses have given conflicting accounts, with some alleging Mogotsi shot at his own car. Police are organising a team to obtain a formal statement from him, and investigators are probing the alleged attempted murder after securing statements. Coverage notes the matter is drawing sustained public and editorial attention, and commentators are calling for Mogotsi to appear before the Madlanga commission into corruption in the criminal justice system.

Turning to public health: Tshwane is facing a worrying spike in typhoid cases. Health reports published today say new typhoid infections have been recorded in the Tshwane metro, with officials and commentators urging urgent action. The outbreak has prompted warnings that failing municipal services may be contributing, and the water ministry has expressed concern about rising cases in the Hammanskraal area specifically. Local media and health writers call on the coalition government in Tshwane to act swiftly to contain the spread, while public health experts urge residents to be alert to symptoms and to follow guidance from health authorities.

In other health and safety news: the National Institute for Communicable Diseases has issued warnings about rabies risks in South Africa ahead of the December holiday travel period. Officials alert the public and travellers to recent rabies cases among dogs, Cape fur seals and other mammals. Nine Cape fur seals in Mossel Bay have tested positive, and authorities are urging people to be cautious around wild and stray animals, particularly in coastal areas where seal encounters occur. Public advisories advise holidaymakers to consider rabies risk when choosing destinations and to avoid contact with potentially infected animals.

On technology and government services: the Presidency and the Department of Transport have jointly piloted a working digital driving licence. A small Presidential team built a functional system in just three months, and authorities demonstrated a live demo of the digital licence platform. Reporting also notes progress on a one-stop government services portal to streamline access to public services. Officials present these as part of a push to modernise administration and make document and service access easier for citizens, though broader rollout and security details remain under discussion.

A quick business and legal update: after an almost two-decade legal battle, inventor Nkosana Makate and Vodacom have reached an out-of-court settlement over the “Please Call Me” invention. Makate said he is relieved the long-running dispute is over following the settlement. Media coverage frames the deal as bringing closure to a case that lasted years, while noting Vodacom had previously contested the matter through the courts.

Finally, education and institutional resilience: civil society groups have rallied to protect the University of Fort Hare after recent arson and destruction at the historic campus. The university is working on a recovery plan and students are gradually returning to campus as administrators seek to restore normal academic activity. Separately, the University of Cape Town’s Child Gauge two thousand and twenty-five report highlighted the intersection of violence against women and children, warning that cycles of violence and neglect during pregnancy are deepening maternal and child health crises.

That is the main news for this Thursday, the sixth of November, two thousand and twenty-five.

That is all for today,
