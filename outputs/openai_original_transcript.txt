First up, on the international legal front with a big domestic angle. Belgium has formally joined South Africa’s case at the International Court of Justice in The Hague, backing Pretoria’s allegations of genocide against Israel over the conflict in Gaza. The move, reported by News24, sees a European partner lending its weight to South Africa’s legal action. Officials say Belgium’s participation reinforces the gravity of the proceedings and adds an extra layer of diplomatic support to South Africa’s petition. The case remains centred on allegations that require examination at the world court, and Belgium’s involvement is likely to extend the coalition of states watching the process closely as it unfolds in The Hague.

In legal and policing news at home: ten members of the Anti-Gang Unit remain behind bars after bail was denied in a high-profile murder case. According to News24 coverage, a police union has strongly criticised the decision, while other reports note the officers will spend Christmas in custody as the criminal matter proceeds. The case has drawn attention for what it reveals about accountability within specialised policing units, and unions are calling for calm even as they express concern about the judicial outcome. Court proceedings will continue, and the matter is likely to remain a focal point for debate on policing, oversight and public trust in the months ahead.

Turning to governance and accountability: former Gauteng health MEC Brian Hlongwa has died after a short illness. Daily Maverick and other outlets report that at the time of his death, Hlongwa faced corruption charges linked to a Special Investigating Unit report which implicated him in alleged fraudulent and corrupt transactions amounting to approximately one point two billion rand in the provincial health department during his tenure. His passing adds a new chapter to ongoing conversations about corruption in public procurement and the long-running investigations into provincial health spending. The Gauteng ANC has acknowledged his death and the matter will be followed closely by those monitoring institutional accountability in the health sector.

In economic and household news that could bring holiday relief: fuel prices are set for a significant drop. News24 reports a massive reduction in petrol and diesel prices coming soon, a development households and businesses may welcome after months of pressure from earlier increases. The report situates the change alongside the wider context of the year’s tax and tariff adjustments, noting that increases in value added tax, the general fuel levy and electricity tariffs earlier in the year had placed strain on consumer budgets. While the exact figures and timing will be confirmed by official notice, the expectation of a sizeable cut in fuel costs will be watched closely by motorists and transport operators who are weighing the impact on household expenses and the cost of doing business.

A sombre look inside the corrections system for the season: News24 has published reporting on what Christmas looks like behind bars. Accounts describe inmates facing cold showers, basic meals of pap and a deep longing for family contact. The series of pieces paints a picture of custodial life during the holidays, highlighting the emotional and material hardships experienced by prisoners and the limited resources available to the Department of Correctional Services to improve conditions. Those stories serve as a reminder of the human dimensions of incarceration and the broader social costs that touch families on both sides of prison walls.
