Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Monday, tenth of November, two thousand and twenty five.

First up: a major investigative story that raises fresh questions about how public money has been claimed and spent. Daily Maverick reports an exclusive into the Collen Mashawana Foundation and what forensic experts describe as massive signatures fraud. The foundation, which featured in a previous Daily Maverick exposé, submitted documents to the Independent Development Trust to claim salaries for participants in a government-funded employment scheme. Forensic analysis found thousands of signatures that are likely forged. Workers who were listed in the documents say they did not receive their wages and some were reportedly made to perform work on private properties owned by the Mashawana family. The Independent Development Trust, now under new management, has said it will probe the allegations. The Daily Maverick reporting describes unpaid labour, duplicated or false signatures and claims amounting to millions of rand. This is a developing story and it puts the spotlight on oversight failures in hiring and payment processes for state-funded projects.

Next: another tender controversy linked to police contracts. News24 has reported that Vusimusi "Cat" Matlala rented a medical clinic on South African Police Service property in Pretoria six months before being awarded a controversial health services tender worth three hundred and sixty million rand. Previous reporting by News24 exposed secret cash payments Matlala allegedly made to key police officials and that he employed a brigadier who evaluated the deal and then resigned. The Department of Public Works has opened an investigation into how Matlala secured the lease. News24’s investigation into the web of influence around this tender argues that Matlala positioned himself ahead of the procurement process by securing the clinic lease well in advance of the tender advertisement. This again raises concerns about access, influence and the integrity of procurements linked to the police service.

In governance and public finance news: reporting across TimesLIVE and other outlets continues to scrutinise irregular procurement and state contract awards. TimesLIVE highlights how security firms raked in one point six billion rand from dodgy contracts at the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa. The investigation points to politically connected companies being the biggest beneficiaries of irregular tenders. This story sits alongside broader coverage of procurement scandals in state entities and adds to mounting pressure for accountability after multiple reports of runaway tenders across several public agencies. The recurring theme in these pieces is the lack of transparency and the involvement of networks that appear to capture contracts and sidestep normal oversight, leaving taxpayers exposed and public services undermined.

Turning to the provinces: severe weather has once again hobbled parts of KwaZulu-Natal. News24 reports that the provincial Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs department has deployed disaster response teams to Newcastle after a severe storm and flooding event wreaked havoc. Municipal engineers and technical teams are conducting inspections to assess damage, particularly where road surfaces and pavings have lifted. Local reporting describes flooding in the Newcastle central business district and power outages in affected areas. Authorities have warned of more heavy rain and urged residents to remain cautious as emergency services work to stabilise damaged infrastructure and restore basic services.

A brief note on public-sector payouts: News24 also reports on a high-profile settlement at the Public Investment Corporation. A former executive, the chief operating officer Vuyani Hako, reportedly received a settlement of ten million rand to leave the organisation after a period of suspension during which a forensic report alleged unexplained payments amounting to four point five million rand. The settlement reportedly included payment of short-term and long-term bonuses while he was suspended. The arrangement has drawn criticism given the findings in the forensic report and comes at a time when trust in the management of state investment and pension funds is already fragile.

Finally, a word on the diplomatic spotlight around the upcoming G20 summit. Media reporting from Daily Maverick and other outlets details tensions after the United States declared it would send no official representative to the G20 meeting in South Africa, citing unfounded claims about persecution of a white minority. South African government spokespeople have publicly dispelled disinformation and defended the integrity of the host processes. The diplomatic row is complicating summit preparations and has prompted local commentary on international interference and narrative wars in the run up to a major multilateral meeting on South African soil.

That is the Mzansi Lowdown for today. That is all for today,
