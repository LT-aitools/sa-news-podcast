Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Wednesday, the seventh of January, two thousand and twenty-six.

First up, a major change at the top of the country’s prosecuting authority. President Cyril Ramaphosa has appointed Advocate Andy Mothibi, currently head of the Special Investigating Unit, as the new National Director of Public Prosecutions. Mothibi will take office on the first of February. This appointment follows a process in which an advisory panel, chaired by Justice Minister Mmamoloko Kubayi, interviewed six current and former prosecutions bosses and concluded none was suitable. Mothibi says he was asked to put his name forward after that finding. The move ends weeks of speculation about who would replace the outgoing NDPP and places the SIU boss at the centre of efforts to restore public confidence in high‑profile prosecutions. We will watch closely how the National Prosecuting Authority responds to this leadership change and what priorities Mothibi sets when he assumes the post.

In municipal politics, Johannesburg councillors are at the centre of controversy over a proposed funeral benefit. The City of Johannesburg is considering a policy that would charge councillors eleven rand and eighty‑two cents a month to provide a so‑called heroes’ burial package. The benefit as proposed would include a grave at Heroes’ Acre, a police band, civic honours, metro police escorts, choir tributes, catering and other ceremonial costs. Critics argue the plan is effectively a lavish send‑off that was not budgeted for, and they say it looks less like support for families and more like an unapproved perk. Supporters frame the policy as filling gaps in councillors’ benefits, since many do not have access to medical aid or unemployment insurance. The debate is intensifying as the city weighs the cost and the optics of committing public resources to ceremonial funerals for elected officials.

From political halls to front‑line emergencies: South Africans in coastal provinces are dealing with destructive fires and evacuations. In the Eastern Cape, Nelson Mandela Bay remains on high alert after dry, windy conditions ignited fast‑spreading veld and bush fires. Parts of the N two highway were closed overnight as firefighters battled blazes that threatened homes and strained local firefighting resources. Authorities say the combination of extreme heat, strong winds and dry vegetation has forced emergency measures and prompted calls for vigilance as the summer fire season intensifies.

Meanwhile on the Garden Route, residents in parts of Mossel Bay were evacuated as vegetation fires threatened residential areas in Island View, Vakansieplaas and Aalwyndal. Reports say several communities were moved to safety, two firefighters were injured in the response and that the N two was temporarily closed before sections were reopened once crews brought conditions under control. Officials continue to urge residents in vulnerable areas to follow evacuation orders and to avoid lighting open fires. Emergency services are stretched as multiple incidents occur across the southern coast.

In Washington and Pretoria, Venezuela is prompting fresh debate inside South African politics. The capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and the subsequent international fallout have produced sharply divided responses here at home. The African National Congress is reported to be demanding the immediate release of President Maduro and condemning his capture as a violation of international law, calling it a threat to global peace. At the same time, opposition parties and other critics are accusing the government of diplomatic hypocrisy and selective outrage, pointing to what they describe as inconsistent responses to foreign interventions. The split has extended beyond party lines, prompting commentary about South Africa’s foreign policy posture and how the country should navigate principles of sovereignty, international law and regional stability. The debate is likely to shape how the government and its partners engage with this unfolding crisis.

Finally, some encouraging news from the tech and start‑up sector. Twelve South African businesses were honoured at the two thousand and twenty‑five South African Startup Awards for innovations addressing local challenges. Winners included SKUBU, which runs packaging‑free grocery solutions, and PayGas, which provides pay‑as‑you‑go energy services for low‑income households. Organisers say the awards reflect a maturing tech ecosystem focused on sustainability and reducing the cost of living. The recognition highlights homegrown entrepreneurs building practical solutions for everyday pressures facing South African families.
