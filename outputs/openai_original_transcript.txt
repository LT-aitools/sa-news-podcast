Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Wednesday, the twelfth of November, two thousand and twenty-five.

First up: a major fallout at the Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Police Department. The City has suspended Deputy Chief of Police Julius Mkhwanazi following allegations of criminality and misconduct linked to the department. Reporting and testimony at the Madlanga commission and in related investigations have painted a picture of serious failings inside the EMPD. Former deputy chief Revo Spies told investigators that fingerprint testing revealed two hundred and seventy-five metro police officers with criminal convictions, and that disciplinary processes were repeatedly stymied. Spies also said Mkhwanazi had assisted a security contractor, Vusimusi “Cat” Matlala, by enabling cars to be registered as EMPD vehicles and fitted with blue lights. City officials have opened a broader probe into the metro police and have announced a disciplinary hearing. The revelations have fed wider concern that the EMPD was operating, in the words of one source, as something close to a criminal enterprise, with allegations that killer and rapist officers remained in service. The suspension is the immediate step; deeper accountability and answers from the municipality and criminal-justice institutions will be closely watched.

In related coverage from Parliament and the justice sector, National Director of Public Prosecutions Shamila Batohi has told MPs that there have been concerted attempts to compromise prosecutors and that South Africa is not winning the fight against organised crime. Batohi appeared before an ad hoc committee probing allegations of corruption in the criminal justice system and said institutions that defend the rule of law are under serious threat. She described a situation where prosecutors have been targeted, with some killed for doing their jobs, and said she learned of certain operational decisions, such as the disbandment of specialised units, through unofficial channels. Members of Parliament pressed her to name a rogue prosecutor allegedly involved in criminal activity. Her testimony drew sharp reactions in the chamber, including a critical exchange with EFF leader Julius Malema. The combination of Batohi’s warnings and the EMPD evidence at the Madlanga commission underlines the depth of concerns about capture, corruption and weakened law-enforcement capacity across the system.

Turning to public health, South Africa has taken a step towards domestic vaccine capability. Clinical trials began for the first locally manufactured oral cholera vaccine, developed by Biovac. The launch of trials has been described as a significant milestone and a potential game changer for outbreak response. Government and health commentators have hailed the move as a way to reduce dependence on foreign pharmaceuticals and to bring faster, targeted protection to rural communities vulnerable to cholera. Coverage notes that this is the first self-made vaccine trial in about fifty years and that stakeholders see it as an important advance for national health security. The trials are now underway and observers will be watching for results that could support wider roll-out.

In the economy and jobs, the latest labour figures show a small but notable improvement in employment. Official statistics indicate that the unemployment rate fell to thirty-one point nine percent in the third quarter, down from thirty-three point two percent in the second quarter. That change reflects the creation of roughly two hundred and forty-eight thousand jobs during the period, with gains reported in construction, social services and trade. Analysts have pointed out that construction work helped to lower the jobless rate, and news coverage stresses that while the numbers are encouraging, the unemployment level remains deeply challenging and will require sustained economic growth and effective policy to bring meaningful relief to millions of South Africans.

On a high-profile criminal case with national resonance, two brothers accused in the murder of rapper Kiernan “AKA” Forbes and Tebello “Tibz” Motsoane were extradited from Eswatini and have arrived in South Africa to face charges. The Ndimande brothers’ return follows a long legal process and has prompted emotional public reactions, including from the mother of the slain rapper. Authorities in KwaZulu-Natal have said investigations continue and that police remain focused on identifying the alleged mastermind behind the hit. The case remains before the courts and will continue to attract close attention as it moves through the legal system.

Before we go a quick note of brighter news from community and civil-society reporting: environmental volunteers and activists continue to push local clean-up efforts across Gauteng and Limpopo. One profile highlighted community organiser Cetric Mphofela, founder of the Cetric Mphofela Foundation, who has led clean-ups in rivers and informal settlements and who plans a long walk across the country to raise awareness about conservation and collective responsibility. It is a reminder that amid national challenges many South Africans are stepping up at grassroots level to keep places livable and to protect natural resources.

That is the Mzansi Lowdown for today.

That is all for today,
