Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Wednesday, the third of December, two thousand and twenty five.

First up: a major development in the State Capture saga. The arrest and charging of Thulani Dlomo, the former State Security Agency operative who was hand-picked by former president Jacob Zuma, is being described by some outlets as a breakthrough. Dlomo faces charges including theft, fraud, forgery and uttering for his alleged role in producing a fake contract to withdraw twelve million rand from State Security Agency coffers in two thousand and fifteen. Reporting indicates the cash was extracted under the cover of a project named Mayibuye, using forged signatures and fabricated paperwork to give the transactions a veneer of legitimacy. His co-accused, Patrick Mshothola, is reported to have been his subordinate in the special operations directorate that Dlomo headed between two thousand and twelve and two thousand and seventeen. Investigations and commentary suggest millions of rands remain unaccounted for, and analysts say this case could shed light on broader intelligence-era abuses. The matter is being raised alongside renewed attention on intelligence networks and their political reach, and commentators say institutional oversight could be tested as further inquiries unfold.

In foreign affairs that directly affect South Africa, the country has been left out of the first G20 meeting under the new United States presidency. South Africa was not invited to a summit in the United States this month, a decision that has prompted debate at home about whether to push for inclusion or accept the exclusion. The move has been framed as a diplomatic slight by some commentators and has prompted questions about how South Africa will manage its G20 engagement going forward. Coverage notes that the United States has launched its G20 presidency with a markedly different agenda and that other members have signalled differing views about who should be included at early sessions. The exclusion is likely to complicate South Africa's immediate representation at a global table it has sought to influence, and the story is being watched for any diplomatic responses from Pretoria.

In economic news, there are signs the economy may be showing modest improvement. Statistics South Africa reported quarterly growth of zero point five percent in the third quarter, marking the fourth consecutive rise in gross domestic product. Analysts are pointing to a one point six percent quarterly increase in spending on fixed assets as evidence that public investment in water and power projects is under way, and this has prompted cautious optimism that the economy may be turning a corner. At the same time, concerns remain about weak private sector investment and international headwinds for trade. Separately, a high-profile financial relief move was announced for depositors of Ithala; the National Treasury and First National Bank are partnering to restore access to frozen savings, with a disbursement of two point two billion rand expected to reach more than two hundred and seventy thousand depositors. That intervention is being framed as significant for households and local confidence, even as broader structural challenges persist.

Motorists should be prepared for higher fuel costs. Multiple outlets are reporting official petrol price increases due to take effect from midnight on Wednesday. One summary indicated petrol will rise by twenty-nine cents per litre, with diesel also set for notable increases. Coverage advised motorists to fill up ahead of the adjustment and detailed that regulatory and global oil movements, together with local cost adjustments, are driving the change. The timing and scale of the increases mean household budgets and business transport costs are likely to feel the immediate impact.

On health: South Africa is preparing for the rollout of a new six-monthly anti-HIV injection. The first batch of lenacapavir shots, commonly called LEN, is expected to arrive in February, and health authorities say distribution should be managed strategically. The minister of health has previously signalled that priority decisions will be needed about who should receive the initial supplies once the medicine becomes available in public clinics. This comes amid broader concern about the state of the HIV response: organisations and reporting around World AIDS Day have highlighted that gains in treatment and prevention are fragile, and the health sector has been warned that cuts to aid and declining preventive behaviours could see progress slip. The LEN arrival offers a promising tool, but experts stress planning and targeting will be essential to make the most of limited early supplies.

A quick domestic governance update: Parliament has established a long-awaited committee to oversee the Presidency, a step presented by legislators as expanding accountability. The new oversight body will aim to make the Presidency answerable to Parliament and to strengthen rules around executive accountability. Political reactions vary, but the move signals that oversight of the highest office remains a live and contested issue in Cape Town.

That is the main news for this morning.

That is all for today,
