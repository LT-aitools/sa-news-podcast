Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is twenty ninth of October, two thousand and twenty five.

First up, the Madlanga commission and fresh questions about the police. Deputy Police Minister Cassel Mathale appeared before the parliamentary ad hoc committee this week as the inquiry into allegations of criminality and political interference in the criminal justice system continues. Lawmakers pressed him over the controversial disbandment of the Political Killings Task Team, or PKTT. Mathale told the committee that the suspended Police Minister Senzo Mchunu expressed unhappiness about the task team but that Mchunu had not consulted widely before moving to disestablish it. Several news outlets covering the hearings reported MPs were unimpressed by parts of Mathale's testimony and said he struggled to answer pointed questions. The broader inquiry is probing claims that elements inside the police service were compromised and whether decisions were taken that undermined investigations into serious and politically sensitive crimes. The commission has already heard evidence linking weapons used in multiple high profile killings, and this week's testimony has only sharpened the spotlight on accountability inside the police and the leadership vacuum created by suspensions and internal disputes.

Next, a high-profile murder investigation that is now the subject of forensic scrutiny. Ekurhuleni audit boss Mpho Mafole, who had flagged irregularities in a tender for chemical toilets worth one point eight billion rand, was murdered on the thirtieth of June this year. Visual and forensic investigations published this week show that Mafole was tracked for hours on the day he was killed. Reporters set out a timeline indicating he was followed from his mother’s East Rand home until he was gunned down. The case has raised serious questions about the personal risks faced by municipal whistleblowers and the need for stronger protections for officials who expose procurement irregularities. Mafole’s work had focused on large contracts and public procurement, and investigators are continuing to probe who may have benefited from the tender he had challenged. The story has reignited debate about corruption, the safety of municipal officials, and how quickly investigators can trace and prosecute those responsible.

In Johannesburg’s Westbury, violence tied to gang turf battles continues to terrorise communities. A recent shooting left two teenagers dead and five people wounded. Residents told reporters they have seen the same cycle of bloodshed and promises from police before. One of the accounts from the area quoted a gang member saying, "My job is to shoot," a grim reminder of how entrenched and brazen the violence has become. The police arrived after the latest attack pledging action, but locals said they are weary of repeated assurances without lasting change. The Westbury clashes underline the wider national challenge of organised-crime networks, the failure of enforcement in some hotspots, and the fragile sense of security for ordinary families living in affected neighbourhoods. Community leaders and policing oversight bodies will be watching whether this latest violence triggers a sustained operational response and meaningful moves to protect civilians and disrupt the gangs’ operations.

Turning to finance and business, WeBuyCars, one of South Africa’s biggest vehicle dealers, saw its shares tumble after a shock trading update. The company flagged that profit growth would decelerate, prompting a sell-off that sent its stock down by about thirteen percent on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. Coverage across financial outlets described the update as weaker than market expectations and noted investor concern over slower earnings momentum. The share price reaction underlines how sensitive markets remain to changes in corporate performance and the tight margins in the automotive sales sector. Analysts and investors will be watching upcoming results and management commentary to see whether the company can stabilise growth or needs to rethink its strategy in a softer consumer environment.

A brief roundup of other items to watch: Parliament continues hearings at the Madlanga commission with further testimony expected; the state of policing oversight remains a central theme in several inquiries; and investigative teams are continuing the forensic timeline in the Mpho Mafole murder as pressure grows for swift arrests and prosecutions.

That is your Mzansi Lowdown for today. That is all for today,
