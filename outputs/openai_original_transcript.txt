Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Sunday, twenty eighth December, two thousand and twenty five.

First up, national finances and local government. Treasury has moved to cut funding to seventy-five municipalities judged to be failing. The move, framed as a constitutional crackdown by government watchdogs and reported developments, signals a tougher stance on municipal mismanagement. The affected municipalities face immediate budgetary constraints as conditional funding is reduced, with the aim of forcing performance improvements and protecting basic services. The cuts are likely to intensify pressure on already strained local administrations and could complicate service delivery for residents depending on those budgets. Authorities say this is a necessary step to uphold fiscal responsibility and the constitution, but the impact on frontline services will be watched closely in the coming weeks.

In governance and procurement news, a major tender scandal has erupted at Sefako Makgatho Health Sciences University. An investigation centres on a student transport contract worth thirty-six million rand, and allegations point to the vice-chancellor’s inner circle as having rigged the award. The story has rocked the university and prompted calls for accountability as stakeholders demand clarity on how the process was run and who stood to benefit. Separately, in the Limpopo construction sector, a contractor has walked off a Polokwane project valued at nine point nine million rand, leaving taxpayers to pick up the bill. That abandoned contract raises questions about procurement oversight and contract management at municipal level. Together, these procurement controversies underline persistent concerns about transparency and the stewardship of public funds.

Turning now to weather and the emergency response across parts of the country. South African Weather Services has issued warnings of severe thunderstorms across Gauteng, and communities in several provinces are braced for heavy and damaging weather. In KwaZulu-Natal, severe storms have already wreaked havoc. Reports indicate about one hundred and twenty-five homes were destroyed in Amajuba and Umzinyathi districts, and emergency teams are assessing damage at health facilities where services have been disrupted. The KZN provincial health department has warned that patient care will be affected as staff and infrastructure recover. Authorities are urging residents to follow warnings, secure property where possible, and avoid travel in areas prone to flash flooding.

A tragic family case in Limpopo is under police investigation after the body of a fifteen-year-old girl was discovered in her home on Christmas Day, and the girl’s father was found hanging from a tree the following day. Reports say the father’s house had been set alight. Provincial police have opened a murder investigation and an inquest has been launched as communities reel from the deaths. This matter highlights continued concerns about rural safety and the urgent need for thorough policing and social support services in affected communities.

Finally, on the international consular front but directly affecting South Africans, families of fourteen workers who are believed to be held against their will in Thailand have appealed for intervention from the Department of International Relations and Co-operation. The families say their loved ones are stranded and have called on Dirco to assist in securing their safe return. The situation has prompted public appeals and highlights the vulnerability of South African nationals working abroad under precarious circumstances. Families are asking for urgent diplomatic engagement to resolve the matter.

A few short items: the South African Medical Association has criticised a proposed four point one percent pay hike for public office bearers, saying it sits uneasily with austerity measures in health budgets. In Cape Town a viral video of a driver littering ended with the motorist turning himself in and paying a fine of five hundred rand. And at Kirstenbosch, a concert by electronic artist The Kiffness drew protests and required increased security measures, as organisers balanced free expression with public order.

That is the Mzansi Lowdown for today. That is all for today,
