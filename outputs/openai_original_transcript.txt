Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is nine December two thousand and twenty-five, South African time.

First up: a major development in the investigation into the killing of whistleblower Marius van der Merwe, known as Witness D at the Madlanga Commission. National police officials have identified three persons of interest in the murder after van der Merwe was gunned down outside his home in Brakpan. Police Commissioner Fannie Masemola has visited the slain man’s home as investigations intensify. Authorities say they have also found a vehicle believed to be linked to the assassination, abandoned in Alexandra, and are detaining people for questioning. Independent Police Investigative Directorate probes remain ongoing into claims van der Merwe made at the commission. The killing has reignited painful memories for families of other slain whistleblowers, and political parties have demanded stronger witness and whistle-blower protection amid fears these murders have a chilling effect on people coming forward. That is the latest on Witness D.

In political news from the ANC national general council, President Cyril Ramaphosa used his opening address to defend the decision to form a government of national unity and to warn delegates that there is no room in the party for criminals and extortionists. The council at Birchwood in Boksburg is taking place against a background of factional tension and renewed questions over leadership and succession. Party staff picketed outside the NGC protesting unpaid salaries, with some senior figures saying outstanding payments date back to two thousand and twenty-three. The NGC comes as speculation grows about possible leadership contenders; reports suggest Electricity Minister Kgosientsho Ramokgopa is weighing a presidential bid and may explore a joint ticket with Agriculture Minister Thoko Didiza ahead of the two thousand and twenty-seven conference. Delegates are being urged to reflect on the party’s record and on the need to steady the ANC while addressing declining voter support.

In economic and jobs news, Eskom has signed an agreement with ferrochrome smelters that is expected to avert mass retrenchments. The state power utility extended a last-minute lifeline to smelters and set in motion a three-month process to design a more sustainable electricity pricing solution for the sector. Labour and industry bodies welcomed the development as it opens a pathway to save jobs in the embattled smelting industry. Trade union NUMSA has been pressing for government intervention to protect employment, and reports say the measures could preserve thousands of positions while a longer-term pricing framework is negotiated. Officials say the focus now turns to stabilising the sector so that the temporary relief translates into sustainable employment.

Turning to a high‑profile criminal case: five people arrested at OR Tambo International Airport in connection with alleged recruitment of South Africans to join the Russian military in the Ukraine conflict were granted bail after appearing in the Kempton Park Magistrate’s Court. One of those charged is a presenter from SAfm. The case has attracted attention locally and internationally and prompted further reporting about alleged schemes to recruit fighters. The court hearings continue and the accused remain on bail while investigations proceed.

On consumer and media matters, talks between local broadcasters and content providers over DStv channels are reported to have stalled over price. Subscribers are concerned as negotiations put several channels at risk of being cut, with operators discussing package reshuffles during the peak festive season. The standoff has prompted anger among viewers and warnings that household access to certain channels could be reduced if terms are not agreed. DStv and content partners are under pressure to reach a deal that balances pricing and service continuity for millions of South African subscribers.

A lighter, community-focused story from Joburg: artist James Delaney has been credited with helping to rejuvenate The Wilds, a sixteen hectare park in Johannesburg’s Killarney area. What was once a derelict and unsafe nature reserve has been transformed into a communal green space. Delaney has publicly said his dog inspired him to take on the project, and local engineering ingenuity now directs discarded water from the Gautrain tunnels to restore the park’s water features. The Wilds is being held up as an example of civic renewal and the power of local commitment to restore public spaces.

A final note on public safety: the country remains on edge after several violent incidents over the weekend, including a mass shooting in Saulsville that left multiple victims and ongoing searches for suspects. Police confirm that some suspects are at large and investigations continue. Communities are calling for faster action and better protection as families seek answers.

That is the Mzansi Lowdown for today.

That is all for today,
