Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is the second of January, two thousand and twenty six, South African time.

First up: a high‑profile oversight finding from the Office of the Public Protector. The Public Protector has delivered its quarterly report into allegations over catering on the presidential aircraft, Inkwazi. The office cleared the Presidency and the Department of Defence of financial misconduct relating to the contested catering arrangements. At the same time, the Public Protector raised concerns about other governance issues, including the misuse of petrol cards and instances of municipal maladministration. The decision ends months of public scrutiny over the Inkwazi catering drama, while the flagged petrol card abuse and municipal failures will draw attention from oversight bodies and parliamentarians going forward.

In KwaZulu‑Natal, police are investigating a brutal New Year attack in Port Shepstone. Gunmen stormed a family home during what authorities described as an alleged robbery and killed four members of the same family. National and local outlets report that police say they are hunting for four suspects in connection with the murders. The killings underline continuing concerns about violent crime in parts of the province, and local law enforcement has appealed for any witnesses with information to come forward as they pursue the suspects.

On our shores, holiday season water tragedies continue to claim lives. At Strand Beach in the Western Cape, rescue services confirm a fatal drowning. Reports say the victim was a man from Elsies River; police have opened an inquest as authorities investigate the circumstances of the death. And along the KwaZulu‑Natal coast, an incident off Pennington main beach left at least one person dead, with one person rescued and three others reported missing in early updates. Emergency services and community volunteers have been active across the coastline during the festive surge, but these incidents are a stark reminder to beachgoers to heed safety warnings and to stay cautious in the surf.

In national leadership news, President Cyril Ramaphosa sent a New Year message to the nation as we entered twenty twenty six. The President reflected on the year just past, noting progress in some areas while acknowledging persistent challenges such as unemployment and crime. He called on South Africans to hold on to hope and to work for unity across communities. In a pointed appeal during the message, he urged men to desist from abusing women and children, highlighting the government’s focus on combating gender‑based violence as part of broader social priorities for the year ahead.

Turning to the economy: the rand is off to a buoyant start in two thousand and twenty six, with coverage noting a strong open to the year. Analysts point to a mix of global and local factors supporting the currency. That strength for the rand comes as motorists may see relief at the pumps soon: fuel analysts and market reports indicate that petrol and diesel price cuts are likely for the January seven price update, driven by a firmer rand and softer international oil prices. The prospect of lower fuel costs will be closely watched, because it has immediate effects on household budgets and broader inflationary pressures.

A few shorter items to note. South African pop star Makhadzi remains in hospital but is reported to be stable following a car accident, with updates saying she is recovering and thanking fans for their support. And on health policy, KwaZulu‑Natal authorities have been reminding the public that new HIV prevention tools, such as the long‑acting injection Lenacapavir, are not a licence for risky behaviour, urging continued responsible health practices as rollout plans proceed.
