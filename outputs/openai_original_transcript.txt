Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Monday, January fifth, two thousand and twenty-six. Here are the top stories you need to know.

First up: South Africa’s diplomatic response to the United States’ operation in Venezuela. The capture of Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro by US forces over the weekend has prompted a firm response from Pretoria. The South African government has called for the United Nations Security Council to urgently convene, describing the US military action as a manifest violation of international law and urging the international community to respond to the crisis. Political parties at home have also reacted: the MK Party reversed earlier support for Donald Trump and condemned what it called an act of war. Analysts and former diplomats are weighing in too; a former South African ambassador to Venezuela said the operation looks like a fight for oil and power, and some commentators warn that South Africa could pay dearly for its stance, pointing to wider geopolitical and economic risks. Officials and civil society here will watch closely in the coming days as Pretoria presses for international debate at the UN.

Next: South Africans stranded in the Russia–Ukraine war zone remain without help. Reporting reveals that seventeen South African men say they were duped into travelling for what they believed was bodyguard training and have been trapped on the frontlines in Russia for five months. They describe a harsh festive season, freezing temperatures, dire conditions and mounting emotional strain. Crucially, the group says there has been no communication or support from South African authorities. That lack of consular contact is the central complaint from those waiting to be repatriated. Families and campaigners are calling on government to make immediate and concrete efforts to secure their return. We will continue to follow any official response and updates on repatriation efforts.

In economic and consumer news: relief at the pumps is on the way. Retail fuel prices in South Africa are set to fall from Wednesday, January seventh, with reports saying petrol will hit its cheapest level since two thousand and twenty-two. Analysts point out that lower fuel prices are good news for inflation, because fuel costs feed directly into transport and energy expenses across the economy. The expected cuts will be monitored closely by consumers and businesses, as changes in fuel costs ripple through food, logistics and everyday living expenses. If these predictions hold, motorists nationwide should see lower prices at service stations from midweek.

Public health and coastal safety: authorities are warning people not to eat shellfish washed up on parts of the West Coast. A developing red tide has caused white mussels, whelks and other shellfish to wash ashore at St Helena Bay and Elandsbaai. Officials caution the public to avoid consuming these shellfish, and Department of Fisheries teams are monitoring the situation. Related reports note dead fish in Mossel Bay, attributed to sewerage problems, and health warnings have been issued in affected coastal communities. If you live or are holidaying along the West Coast, do not collect or eat shellfish from these areas and follow guidance from local health departments.

And finally a quick domestic round-up: power woes are affecting heritage sites in Gqeberha, where vandalism at a substation plunged St Augustine’s Cathedral into prolonged darkness in December. There are also concerns at national level about accountability and court activity in Nelson Mandela Bay, where high-profile criminal trials and municipal corruption cases are expected to shape local politics this year. Education and public-sector debates are already restarting after the holidays, and civil society groups are pushing for measurable government commitments on service delivery.

That is the Mzansi Lowdown for today.

That is all for today,
