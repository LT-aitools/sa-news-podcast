Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is three November two thousand and twenty five.

First up: a high‑profile criminal investigation is being restarted from scratch. More than two and a half years after Cloete and Thomas Murray were killed in a brazen shooting, police have handed the case to a fresh detective team. The new unit is under the command of Gauteng top cop Major General Mbuso Khumalo. The Murray family has said they welcome the renewed focus, but their hope is tempered by thirty months of disappointment. That is what the reporting has established so far: a new team, new leadership, and a family cautiously waiting for results.

Next: Gauteng police have launched a manhunt following a deadly drive‑by shooting in Reiger Park, Boksburg. The incident left six people dead and three injured. Provincial police commissioner Masemola has deployed a specialised team to hunt down the killers and has vowed to bolster policing in the area. Paramedics and emergency services described horrific scenes at the scene and communities are reeling. Authorities say they are closing in on suspects, and national and provincial law‑enforcement resources have been mobilised as investigations continue.

In national governance news: former president Thabo Mbeki is calling for changes to how South Africa elects its president. Speaking at a National Dialogue event, Mr Mbeki argued that the current presidential election process is wrong and urgently needs reform to address the multiple crises facing the country. He said an inclusive dialogue is required to find structural fixes. Coverage highlights his warning that South Africa needs urgent intervention to steady its economy and institutions, and that reforming the presidential selection process should form part of that national conversation.

Turning to local government and service delivery: Johannesburg’s water crisis remains a major story. Residents from Thembelihle to Soweto are reporting prolonged outages that are disrupting schools, threatening public health and fuelling crime, according to on‑the‑ground reporting. Civil society groups are demanding urgent action and accountability from the City as frustrations deepen. Meanwhile, reporting has exposed that two contractor companies with limited track records continue to draw on a three‑year, two hundred and twenty three million rand water‑supply contract intended to keep taps flowing during outages. That situation has prompted questions about oversight and whether the contract is delivering value while many communities remain without reliable water.

In higher education and public institutions: the chairperson of the National Student Financial Aid Scheme board, Dr Karen Stander, has resigned with immediate effect. She cited a toxic work environment marked by racism, bullying, intimidation and threats to her family’s safety as reasons for stepping down. NSFAS is a cornerstone of student support and her resignation raises fresh concerns about governance and culture at an institution central to access to tertiary education for thousands of students.

In public interest reporting: a judge has handed a significant ruling on energy regulation. A high court found that the National Energy Regulator of South Africa’s process for approving municipal electricity tariff hikes is unconstitutional. The court has ordered Nersa to implement new timelines to allow proper public participation in future decisions. The finding is being touted as a victory for consumers and for procedural fairness, and it may influence how municipalities and regulators consult the public on future tariff decisions.

And finally, a governance and accountability piece out of the Eastern Cape: families in rural areas continue to face serious health risks from diagnostic failures. Reporting has shown the anguish of an Eastern Cape family whose young relative was wrongly treated for tuberculosis instead of cancer. Misdiagnosis between TB and cancers such as lymphoma remains a significant clinical challenge in rural parts of South Africa with high TB rates, and the human cost was highlighted in that coverage.

That is the rundown for today. That is all for today.
