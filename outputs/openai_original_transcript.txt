Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is eleventh December two thousand and twenty five.

First up: politics and the race to lead the African National Congress after President Cyril Ramaphosa. Fresh polling and analysis show a wide open succession contest with surprise surges and shifting front‑runners. For the first time two women have entered the field, marking a notable development in what analysts call a crowded and uncertain race. The National General Council has also been a backdrop for hard conversations about the party's performance since the two thousand and twenty four elections. Delegates are debating whether the ANC has learned those lessons, and whether it can convince voters it is serious about renewal ahead of next year’s local government elections.

On the provincial front the party has admitted a retreat in KwaZulu‑Natal. Officials described the earlier intervention there as a “Toyota Tazz, not a Ferrari,” acknowledging the effort fell far short of expectations. That admission signals more shakeups in provincial leadership and renewed focus on delivery, as the ANC tries to reassure members and voters that it can pivot from factionalism to governance.

In governance news: the contest for the National Director of Public Prosecutions is unfolding under intense scrutiny. Day one of interviews produced moments that observers described as both strong and problematic. The selection process drew immediate political pushback — the Democratic Alliance has threatened court action over the shortlisting of candidates, calling some inclusions “irrational and unlawful.” Government ministers have responded by urging the process to proceed, but the dispute has raised questions about transparency and the independence of the prosecuting authority at a time when public trust in institutions is fragile.

Education authorities are facing a serious integrity challenge. The Department of Basic Education has confirmed a breach in the marking process for the two thousand and twenty five National Senior Certificate examinations. Early reports indicate the breach was discovered during marking procedures and has been escalated to Umalusi, the quality assurance body. Coverage across outlets notes the department is cooperating with oversight bodies and that investigations are under way to assess the scope of the problem and any impact on results. This development will be closely watched by parents, schools and learners as officials determine next steps and possible remedies.

A local court and police matter made national headlines this morning. Prominent philanthropist and businessman Crispin Sonn has been charged after a violent altercation in Sea Point that began as a parking dispute. Video that circulated shows tensions escalating until Sonn reportedly struck a resident, prompting a wider brawl. Sonn and his attorney have said they will file countercharges. The incident occurred shortly after the death of Sonn’s father, Franklin Sonn, who served as South Africa’s first ambassador to the United States; the family connection has only increased public interest in the case. Authorities have proceeded with formal charges and the matter will continue through the criminal process.

In conservation and the environment: the Western Cape has expanded its protected areas by an additional forty‑seven thousand hectares. Two new nature reserves were declared and two existing reserves were extended, creating vital space for the Cape mountain zebra to breed and strengthening protections for threatened succulent plants, mammals and bird species across the province. Conservation groups and provincial authorities say the expansion will help biodiversity and ecosystem resilience in a region facing ongoing environmental pressures.

A couple of shorter headlines: the South African Post Office is attracting strong private sector interest in plans to partner on its assets, signalling possible shifts in state business models; and the ongoing national discussion about the ANC’s internal renewal continues to dominate political coverage, with commentators asking what visible improvements in service delivery would convince voters the party has changed.
