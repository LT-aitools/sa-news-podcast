First up: festive hunger and community relief in the Eastern Cape. Daily Maverick and SA Harvest have launched their third joint campaign to feed children over the holidays, focusing on Nelson Mandela Bay and vulnerable holiday programmes. Organisers say schools and early learning centres are closed for the season and many youngsters lose access to school feeding schemes and safe daytime supervision. The drive is starting in Nelson Mandela Bay because the metro has seen worrying increases in severe acute malnutrition, including rural areas and now the Bay itself. More than two dozen children have died in the area in the past year, the newsletter notes, and the campaign hopes to prevent hunger and keep children safe through holiday programmes.

The project aims to supply a “Bucket of Nutrition” that organisers describe as comprehensive. Each bucket includes staples like ten kilograms of maize meal, five kilograms of rice, two kilograms of samp, tinned proteins, soya mince, peanut butter, instant milk powder, powdered meal packs, vegetables, sugar, cooking oil, stock cubes, cleaning items and a few treats. The estimated cost per bucket is eight hundred and forty-eight rand, though the buckets are offered at one thousand rand this year because they include more nutritious items and cleaning materials. Donations of any size are welcome and the campaign is aiming to distribute two thousand buckets, working with Missionvale Care Centre, the Walmer Angel Project and MTR Smit Children’s Haven to reach families the community trusts.

Environmental and public health concerns along the KwaZulu‑Natal coastline: eThekwini municipality has closed four beaches after pollution and sewage contamination raised fears for bathers. Multiple outlets reported the temporary closures and described mounting legal and operational battles over sewage management in the metro. The municipality has faced court challenges and criticism from opposition parties over the handling and reopening of beaches amid elevated E. coli risks. Residents and visitors are being advised to avoid affected bathing spots while authorities continue water-quality testing and work to address the sewage problems that have triggered the closures this week.

Road safety and festive-season enforcement: authorities report a drop in road fatalities so far this season, with transport officials crediting tougher policing and public-awareness campaigns. Transport minister Creecy has pointed to a fall of more than twenty percent in road deaths in the early part of the festive season. At the same time, police have intensified roadblocks and drunk‑driving operations, leading to thousands of arrests for driving under the influence and other traffic offences. The message from the state is clear: tougher enforcement will continue through the heavy-traffic holiday period, and motorists should expect more checkpoints and targeted operations aimed at reducing crashes and fatalities.

A quick diplomatic note that has national implications: South African authorities have publicly pushed back against threats from the United States related to the deportation of certain foreign nationals. Coverage shows Pretoria rejected what it described as threats over the removal of seven Kenyan nationals linked to irregular processing of immigration documents for Afrikaners bound for the United States. This dispute has escalated diplomatic tensions and follows other exchanges between the two governments. Separately, the United States Senate confirmed Leo Brent Bozell the third as the incoming U.S. ambassador to South Africa, a development reported alongside coverage of the strained relations. Both items are emerging elements in an ongoing diplomatic story between Pretoria and Washington.

And finally, a short media note: the country continues to mourn Warrick Stock, known as DJ Warras, with memorials and police promises to pursue suspects in his killing. Coverage over the last two days described memorial services and ongoing investigations, with police saying arrests remain a priority.

That is your Mzansi Lowdown for today.

That is all for today.
