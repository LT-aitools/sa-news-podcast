Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is twenty eighth of November, two thousand and twenty five.

First up: diplomatic tensions with the United States. The news this week is that former US president Donald Trump has said South Africa will not be invited to next year’s G20 summit in Miami. The move follows a dispute over this year’s G20 presidency handover, and South African officials have described the decision as punitive. President Cyril Ramaphosa has publicly defended South Africa’s sovereignty and its right to participate in global platforms, calling for unity in response to what was framed in local coverage as an insult to the country. South African officials are already discussing next steps and alternative ways to engage with G20 members and the broader international community, noting that South Africa’s membership has the backing of other member states. This is an evolving diplomatic story that could have implications for how South Africa positions itself on international economic and security matters.

Next: urgent concern among health non‑governmental organisations. Following public comments by President Trump about stopping US “payments and subsidies” to South Africa, local health NGOs report growing fear and confusion. Organisations that rely on external funding, including long‑running programmes supported by US partners, are now unsure about the future of that support. Reports in our sources say NGOs are seeking clarity from both US and South African authorities about what funding may be affected and how services will be sustained if aid is reduced or withdrawn. Public health experts and civil society warn that sudden cuts could worsen already strained services in clinics and community programmes, particularly those tackling complex health challenges. This story ties directly into domestic healthcare pressures and underlines how international policy shifts can have immediate consequences for delivery on the ground.

Now to parliamentary testimony and allegations of political corruption. Vusimuzi “Cat” Matlala, a businessman and accused organised‑crime figure, gave dramatic testimony before Parliament’s ad hoc committee this week. He told MPs that former national police minister Bheki Cele demanded one million rand from him, and that Cele frequently asked to stay at Matlala’s penthouse. Matlala has also alleged that his security company provided “backup security” to the Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Municipality during Mayor Mzwandile Masina’s predecessor’s administration, and that he donated vehicles to the Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Police Department. Matlala has previously claimed to have made a payment of five hundred thousand rand to stop perceived harassment by an investigative unit, and he expanded on those allegations during hearings. Parliament and opposition MPs reacted strongly; some members dismissed Matlala as an unreliable and dishonest witness, while others called for investigations. Separately, an Eswatini home affairs official has been arrested over allegations she issued Matlala with fraudulent documentation. These hearings raise serious questions about procurement, political interference in policing, and the links between private security companies and municipal contracts.

In legal and governance news: the shortlist for the National Director of Public Prosecutions, the NDPP, has been announced with six candidates named to replace outgoing NDPP Shamila Batohi, who retires in January. Notably among the shortlisted is Menzi Simelane, the former prosecutions boss whose appointment by ex‑president Jacob Zuma was invalidated by the Constitutional Court in two thousand and twelve after critical findings in the Ginwala inquiry. Simelane’s inclusion has reignited debate about fitness and integrity criteria for the country’s top prosecutorial post. The president will have less than two months to decide on a successor, and commentators say this appointment will be closely watched given the high stakes for the national anti‑corruption agenda and public confidence in prosecutions.

Turning to infrastructure and water management: the Department of Water and Sanitation opened sluice gates at the Vaal Dam as water levels rose rapidly. Reporting indicates that up to ten sluice gates are now open to manage inflows and reduce pressure on the dam system. Officials described the situation as under control and said further gates have been opened as a precaution. Engineers and municipal authorities are monitoring downstream effects and coordinating water releases to safeguard communities and critical infrastructure. The rapid rise in levels follows heavy rainfall in catchment areas and underscores the continuing challenges of managing large dam systems in extreme weather conditions.

A quick wrap on governance oversight. The Office of the NDPP and parliamentary committees continue to pursue inquiries into prosecutorial decisions, withdrawals of charges, and the conduct of senior legal officials. Recent testimony and submissions have focused on whether proper processes were followed in high‑profile cases, and watchdog groups are demanding transparency. These debates feed directly into public trust in the criminal justice system and will influence pending appointments and legal reviews in the coming weeks.

That is all for today,
