Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Thursday, thirteenth of November, two thousand and twenty-five.

First up: a major cabinet reshuffle. President Cyril Ramaphosa has accepted changes to the National Executive that include the removal of Environment Minister Dion George. The Democratic Alliance requested that the wildlife portfolio be taken from him, and the President has appointed new leadership in the department. Dion George has publicly said he respected the party decision and insisted he had been doing his job without fear, favour or prejudice. The Democratic Alliance’s national spokesperson, Willie Aucamp, has been named to the forestry, fisheries and environment post, according to official announcements and reporting. This comes as political parties reposition ahead of the G20 summit and a busy policy season.

In economic news: Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana delivered the Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement and Treasury set out a cautiously upbeat picture. The government has adjusted the official inflation target down to three percent with a one point tolerance band, the first such change in twenty-five years. Stronger tax collections mean SARS is expected to rake in almost twenty billion rand more than forecast earlier in the year, narrowing the budget deficit and giving Treasury some breathing room. Godongwana announced targeted savings and an emphasis on growth and jobs, while allocating one hundred million rand to close a funding shortfall for hosting the G20 leaders summit.

Markets reacted. The rand moved positively on the back of the budget announcements, reflecting relief over the lower inflation target and improved fiscal management. Treasury framed the MTBPS as a return from the brink, with talk of structural reforms, tighter management of state-owned entities and measures to tackle municipal arrears to Eskom. That issue remains pressing: municipal debt to Eskom has rocketed, and officials warned it threatens Eskom’s viability unless distribution-agency agreements and debt solutions are scaled up.

Turning to Gauteng and public safety: more than six thousand crime prevention wardens who were appointed by the provincial government now face possible unemployment after their programme was declared unlawful. The initiative, launched by Premier Panyaza Lesufi and colloquially known as AmaPanyaza, was to be followed by retraining through the Road Traffic Management Corporation. But the RTMC is reportedly bankrupt and has no capacity to retrain the cohort after the entity failed to deliver on its mandate. That leaves many individuals in limbo and raises wider questions about planning, oversight and the cost of implementing provincial security interventions that rely on fragile implementing partners. The story has sparked criticism and renewed scrutiny of provincial rollout and procurement practices.

Back in Gauteng, serious allegations continue to surface at the Madlanga Commission. Former Ekurhuleni officials have testified that city managers shielded metro police officers accused of wrongdoing. One former official said he was told to "leave Julius alone" when he sought to extend a suspension of an EMPD boss, Brigadier Julius Mkhwanazi, who now faces suspension amid claims that a rogue unit operated with impunity for years. News24 and Daily Maverick reporting indicate that questions remain about whether city managers and other officials protected individuals who allegedly abused priorities and unlawfully registered vehicles with blue-light privileges. Ekurhuleni has launched probes and suspended senior officers as part of a broader effort to root out misconduct.

A note on violent crime in the Western Cape: police have launched manhunts after multiple shootings and murders in Cape Town suburbs. Reporting from News24 and other outlets details incidents where three people were found dead in a car in Mitchell’s Plain and separate triple murders in areas including Lentegeur and Montclair. Investigations are under way and police sought public help as gang-related violence appears to be escalating in parts of the city. Authorities say more arrests are imminent in some cases, and communities remain on edge as investigations continue.

Finally, the G20 summit in Johannesburg is shaping national preparations and political debate. The city has undergone a rushed makeover to prepare for visiting delegations, and national authorities continue to adjust logistics and security plans. Several heads of state have signalled they will not attend, with a handful of leaders confirmed as no-shows; Pretoria has said it remains confident the summit will be successful despite those absences. The government is also managing the optics of cleaning up and delivering last-minute municipal fixes, and civil society groups are watching closely as resources are reallocated ahead of the leaders’ arrival.

That is today’s Mzansi Lowdown.

That is all for today,
