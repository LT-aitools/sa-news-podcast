Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is twenty fourth of November, two thousand and twenty five.

First up: G20 and President Cyril Ramaphosa. South Africa closed a high-profile G20 Leaders Summit in Johannesburg over the weekend with President Ramaphosa describing his feelings as relief and satisfaction. The summit adopted a Leaders’ Declaration early in the programme, a move reported as unorthodox but intended to prevent backtracking. Delegates praised the summit for focusing on global economic challenges, climate finance and elevating Africa’s role. The meeting took place amid the controversy of a United States boycott by President Donald Trump, but several leaders and ministers publicly commended South Africa’s handling of the event. The presidency now shifts to the United States, and officials here say African interests must remain on the agenda as the handover takes place.

Next: diplomatic tensions and visa revocations. The United States revoked the visa of former international relations minister Naledi Pandor, a move that drew attention during the summit. Minister in the Presidency Khumbudzo Ntshavheni told reporters the cabinet is not worried about the visa revocations and said the decision does not change the price of bread. South African officials have pushed back on criticism from the Trump administration over President Ramaphosa’s conduct at the summit, with the Presidency and other ministers defending South Africa’s approach to hosting the G20.

In political and legal headlines: the Zuma family dispute linked to recruitment of South Africans to fight in Ukraine. A criminal complaint has been opened by Nkosazana Bonganini Zuma-Mncube against her stepsister Duduzile Zuma-Sambudla. The complaint centres on allegations that men were lured to Russia under false pretences and ended up in the front line in the Donbas region of Ukraine. Reporting indicates that as many as eighteen South African men are trapped in dangerous conditions there, describing explosions, drone activity, mine detonations and lack of medical care. Nkosazana filed an affidavit at a Sandton police station and the matter has been handed to the Hawks’ Crimes Against the State unit for further investigation. Authorities say the complaint will be examined and legal steps pursued where warranted.

Turning to the economy and industry: the smelter closure crisis and its toll on mines and jobs. Reporting over the weekend detailed a collapse across the coal-to-smelter value chain. More than thirty mines have closed as smelters vanish from the market. The situation has left more than one million tonnes of anthracite coal stranded and has resulted in the loss of thousands of jobs. Affected mining communities include areas around Newcastle, Mtubatuba and Machadadorp. Municipalities and businesses are confronting the scale of stranded stockpiles and the social and economic fallout in mining towns.

On governance and procurement: a high-value tender and questions over municipal pay. Weekend coverage flagged a R three hundred and sixty million tender involving Cat Matlala in a weekly wrap of major stories. At the same time, investigative reporting has highlighted soaring executive pay at the City of Johannesburg, describing increases that break municipal rules even as service delivery collapses in parts of the city. The city administration has also been under pressure to sustain the service delivery gains that were visible during the G20 showcase, with the mayor saying work will continue beyond the summit. Those are developments to watch as legal and oversight processes consider procurement, remuneration and accountability.

Law enforcement and corruption news: arrests involving a Hawks officer. The Hawks and the Tembisa Hospital suspended official were arrested in a sting connected to alleged gratification payments. Reports say the arrests relate to approximately one hundred thousand rand and that an investigation is under way. Separately, other anti-corruption operations continue across provinces as investigators pursue allegations of bribery and graft in public institutions.

Finally, weather and safety reminders. Authorities warned of severe thunderstorms in several provinces over the coming days, and disaster management teams remain on alert, particularly in KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape. If you are travelling or in vulnerable areas, follow local advisories and allow extra time on the roads.

That is the main news for South Africa this morning.

That is all for today,
