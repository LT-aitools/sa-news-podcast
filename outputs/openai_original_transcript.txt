Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is twelve December two thousand twenty five. Here are the stories you need to know.

First up: at the ANC’s National General Council this week, the party has named President Cyril Ramaphosa to lead its local government election campaign for two thousand twenty six. Delegates used the closing sessions of the gathering to underline the ANC’s commitment to transformation policies, including defending the National Health Insurance and black economic empowerment as non negotiable priorities. The council also framed this as part of the party’s renewal project, praising members who stepped aside over integrity concerns and signalling a push to transform structures ahead of the two thousand twenty seven national conference.

The NGC’s tone was firm: the ANC intends to steer the transformation agenda even as it seeks working relations with governing partners in the national unity government. That stance has produced friction with the South African Communist Party, and the NGC resolved to bar SACP representatives from taking part in the ANC’s election strategy meetings after the SACP signalled it may contest elections independently of the tripartite alliance. Those are big political moves with implications for alliance dynamics as the country heads into an intense local election year.

In crime and education: the Department of Basic Education has suspended two officials after an investigation uncovered a leak of National Senior Certificate examination papers and marking memoranda in Tshwane. Authorities say twenty six pupils across seven Pretoria schools had access to English Home Language, mathematics and physical science question papers and marking guidelines. Vigilant markers flagged the irregularities when candidates’ answers closely mirrored the official marking memo. The department has opened a national investigation and suspended the staff members pending further action. The discovery has prompted calls for tightened security around exam material and renewed scrutiny of examination processes ahead of the summer marking and results period.

Turning to the National Prosecuting Authority appointment process: interviews for the next National Director of Public Prosecutions concluded this week with three final candidates taking the hot seat — Hermione Cronje, Xolisile Khanyile and Menzi Simelane. The hearings produced sharp moments. Cronje, the former head of the Investigating Directorate, told the advisory panel that the NPA is fixable but only if the deep crises within the institution are confronted head on. She laid blame, in part, at the feet of Menzi Simelane, accusing him of contributing to divisions at the NPA. Simelane, meanwhile, admitted previously blocking the prosecution of Bosasa on the grounds that he did not trust the investigative unit involved.

Separately, prominent advocate Tembeka Ngcukaitobi publicly accused National Director of Public Prosecutions Shamila Batohi of lying under oath over whether an expert adviser had been involved in evidence related to former spyboss Richard Mdluli. Batohi has defended her record in the interviews and told the inquiry panel she had no reason to mislead it, though parts of her handling of related matters have come under scrutiny. The appointment panel and the President’s advisers now face a fraught choice: who is best placed to stabilise prosecutions, rebuild credibility and carry out high risk, high profile matters without political interference.

In law enforcement and corruption probes: the Special Investigating Unit executed search and seizure operations across Gauteng and KwaZulu Natal this week in connection with a sophisticated scheme that allegedly siphoned funds from the Unemployment Insurance Fund’s Covid-19 Temporary Employer/Employee Relief Scheme. Authorities named suspects tied to an alleged fraud of approximately one hundred sixty one million rand. Among those implicated is a councillor from the uMkhonto weSizwe Party in KwaZulu Natal, identified as a central figure in the alleged syndicate. The raids mark an escalation in efforts to recover funds and hold networks accountable for taking emergency relief meant for employers and workers during the pandemic.

And finally, some good news for South African wine. The country secured a strong international showing in The World’s Fifty Best Vineyards two thousand twenty five list, with six South African estates placing inside the global Top One Hundred. Standouts include Klein Constantia, which was ranked number six and named the best vineyard in Africa, and Creation, which followed closely in seventh place. The success highlights South Africa’s continued reputation for world class terroir and winemaking, and the list offers a welcome lift for tourism and the Western and Southern Cape wine routes as the industry builds into the summer season.
