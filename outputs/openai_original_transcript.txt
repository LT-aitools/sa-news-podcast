Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Friday, the thirty first of October, two thousand and twenty five.

First up: explosive testimony at the Madlanga Commission. Witness C gave detailed evidence about businessman Vusimuzi "Cat" Matlala, saying Matlala told investigators he paid large sums to senior police figures and even into political campaigns. According to the testimony reported, Matlala allegedly paid five hundred thousand rand towards the sidelined police minister Senzo Mchunu’s campaign for the African National Congress presidency, and believed the minister did not honour his side of a deal. Witness C also told the commission that Matlala claimed to have paid suspended deputy national commissioner Lieutenant‑General Shadrack Sibiya repeated cash payments — testimony that included accounts of money dropped off in parcels, cash hidden in dustbins, and even deliveries described as twenty impalas, a reference heard in the proceedings. These revelations form part of a wider investigation into allegations that organised crime has penetrated the criminal justice system, and the commission continues to examine claims of political interference and corruption. The testimony has prompted renewed attention on oversight of policing and on the ad hoc parliamentary processes already looking into the matter.

In another serious story, South Africans who travelled to Myanmar seeking work remain at the centre of an international trafficking and scam scandal. One South African man has described being lured by a job posting and then trafficked to a scam centre near the Thailand border where he was forced, under threat and brutal working conditions, to extort older victims online using artificial intelligence and fabricated social‑media material. He said shifts ran as long as sixteen hours a day, pay was minimal, and living quarters were overcrowded. An NGO, Brave to Love, reported that a group of forty one South Africans recently escaped from the notorious KK Park compound in Myanmar, and diplomatic channels are reported to be coordinating to assist citizens stranded on the Thai‑Myanmar border. Authorities and civil society are engaged in efforts to bring people home and to investigate the recruitment networks that led to this abuse.

Turning to a landmark court judgment: the inquest into the death of Chief Albert Luthuli, former ANC president‑general and Nobel Peace Prize winner, has produced a historic ruling. A South African court concluded that Chief Luthuli was beaten to death by apartheid police in nineteen sixty seven and described how the law was used systematically to enforce apartheid. The Pietermaritzburg High Court ordered an investigation into the disappearance of a witness linked to the matter. The judgment marks the end of a long reopened inquest and has been described in reporting as exposing an apartheid era cover up, with the court instructing state authorities to pursue further inquiries to establish accountability and to locate missing witnesses. This decision has revived public debate about historical justice and the state’s duty to investigate unresolved political killings.

Locally in KwaZulu‑Natal, the provincial government is taking action to reclaim state property that has been occupied illegally for decades. The KwaZulu‑Natal Department of Public Works says buildings owned by the department have been occupied by criminals and by families of former employees since nineteen ninety four. MEC Martin Meyer announced plans to work with the police and to establish a provincial task team to reclaim control of the properties. Once reclaimed, the province intends to repurpose the structures to increase affordable housing stock. The announcement frames the operation as part of broader efforts to restore state assets and to tackle entrenched illegal occupation that has undermined service delivery and state infrastructure.

And another item from national government oversight: the Department of Public Works unveiled measures to tackle chronic construction delays and poor delivery on state projects. Officials have proposed a blacklist for contractors who delay projects and a six point action plan to expedite government construction. The plan includes tools such as a digital dashboard to track projects and stronger enforcement against firms that fail to deliver. The policy aims to cut through long standing procurement and implementation failures that have cost taxpayers and delayed essential services.

Finally, a brief note on trust in policing and witness safety. Courts and hearings continue to flag concerns about witness protection after reports earlier this week that a third witness in an unrelated matter died under circumstances that prompted calls for toxicology and security investigations. The Madlanga Commission and parliamentary inquiries are already pressing these issues, and political leaders have said there will be moves to shake up police leadership where corruption or capture is evident.

That is the Mzansi Lowdown for today. That is all for today,
