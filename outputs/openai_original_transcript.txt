Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Tuesday, the twenty eighth of October, two thousand and twenty five.

First up: continued fallout at the Madlanga commission of inquiry into alleged corruption and political interference in the criminal justice system. This week the commission heard new ballistic evidence linking firearms across multiple high-profile murders. A political killings task team expert told the inquiry that the AK-47 confiscated in the murder of engineer Armand Swart was also used in the shootings of musicians Oupa Sefoka, known as DJ Sumbody, Hector Buthelezi, known as DJ Vintos, and businessman Don Tindleni. The revelation underlines concerns the commission is probing about organised violence and mismanagement in police forensic processes. Separately, a senior forensic analyst testified and defended the integrity of ballistic work, while another expert rejected claims that errors in a ballistic report were part of sabotage. The hearings continue to shed light on how weapon tracing and forensic reporting may have contributed to confusion in major investigations. Trust in policing is at stake as parliament and the commission press for answers.

In policing and political developments: two deputy police ministers still report having no delegated responsibilities more than a year into the job. Deputy Police Minister Cassel Mathale told the Ad Hoc Committee hearings that suspended Police Minister Senzo Mchunu had not formally delegated duties to him or to the other deputy, Polly Boshielo. Mathale also said Mchunu had voiced unhappiness about the Political Killings Task Team, or PKTT, despite evidence of successes, and hinted at disestablishing the unit. That discussion has become central as the PKTT’s future and the handling of politically linked murders remain a flashpoint. Meanwhile, National Coloured Congress Member of Parliament Fadiel Adams has lodged criminal perjury charges against KwaZulu-Natal police commissioner Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi, related to previously retracted allegations concerning former police minister Bheki Cele. The mounting legal and parliamentary actions underscore deep tensions inside policing leadership and the broader oversight apparatus.

Turning to crime on the ground: police in Pretoria have arrested a suspect in the Mamelodi East double murder that shocked the community. Two cousins were reportedly shot execution-style, and reporting linked to the case said a third victim has since emerged. Community outrage mounted after the killings, prompting calls for stronger action on gender-based violence and violent crime. Activists and public figures have been vocal, and the investigation is ongoing as authorities move the suspect through the justice system.

In health policy, there are major developments on two fronts. First, the national launch of renewed political focus on tuberculosis. Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi has relaunched the South African TB Caucus and reaffirmed a governmental commitment to ending the disease. The caucus was presented as a platform to mobilise political leadership and accelerate the Department of Health’s End TB campaign, which aims to test five million people for tuberculosis during the twenty twenty five to twenty twenty six period. Second, South Africa has approved a long acting anti-HIV injection that is expected to curb new infections. Reports say the newly registered product, lenacapavir, or another twice-a-year option, marks a milestone: South Africa is now the first African country to register a twice-a-year anti-HIV jab, and the injection is expected to arrive in November. Advocates and health bodies, including Bhekisisa and government reporting, framed the approval as a breakthrough for prevention options, with potential to reshape HIV prevention strategies across the country.

In business news, WeBuyCars, one of South Africa’s largest vehicle dealers, issued a trading statement that flagged profit deceleration and prompted a sharp market reaction. Shares plunged after the company warned that earnings growth would slow, a development that market commentators say caught investors off guard. The trading update has raised questions about prospects in consumer spending and the used vehicle marketplace. Analysts will be watching WeBuyCars’ full results later this month for detail on margins, vehicle supply and the outlook into next year.

And finally, a roundup of governance and public service pressures: parliament’s higher education committee reported alarm at crises across several universities, including governance and student safety concerns at Fort Hare and the University of the Free State, and ongoing NSFAS failures. The committee called for urgent corrective action as unrest and infrastructure problems continue to affect campuses and student welfare. Separately, the South African National Aids Council urged stronger local supply chains to end tuberculosis, calling for secure manufacturing and procurement to keep medicines and diagnostics flowing. The public health and higher education briefs together point to a running theme in oversight: the need for better systems, clearer accountability and resilient supply chains.

That is the Mzansi Lowdown for today.

That is all for today,
