Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is ten December two thousand and twenty-five in South African time.

First up: accountability and safety in the justice system. Justice Minister Mmamoloko Kubayi has pushed back against criticism after the assassination of a key witness, Marius van der Merwe, connected to the Madlanga Commission. The minister defended the State’s handling of whistleblower protection, while acknowledging significant legislative gaps that remain. Opposition parties have accused her of attempting to shift blame by proposing restrictions on live broadcasts of testimony, but the minister says the right to life must take precedence over public interest as the government seeks a review of public testimony procedures. The assassination has intensified calls from civic groups and faith organisations for authorities to go after the masterminds behind attacks on whistleblowers. This remains a live issue as Parliament and the justice cluster consider reforms aimed at strengthening witness protection and addressing perceived failures in existing safeguards.

In politics: the African National Congress is in the thick of internal debate at its national general council in Boksburg, and veterans of the party are urging tougher consequence management. The ANC Veterans’ League wants the so‑called step‑aside rule tightened and extended to members of Parliament, arguing uneven enforcement has undermined the party’s credibility. Delegates at the council are also grappling with a sharp diagnosis of the party’s electoral decline, and there are heated conversations about leadership, accountability and campaign funding. In related developments, provincial task teams are being readied to hand back structures to elected leaders as investigations into allegations such as vote buying proceed. The message from senior ANC voices is clear: if the party is to rebuild trust, internal discipline and visible action on corruption must follow.

Now to crime and education in Gauteng. Armed illegal miners, known locally as zama zamas, have turned Wedela Technical High School in Carletonville into a nightly hunting ground. The men exchanged gunfire with police after being caught stealing electricity cables, leaving more than one thousand four hundred pupils without electricity, running water and access to key technical learning equipment. The outage has forced some learners to travel to other schools for practical subjects, and community patrollers who try to guard the school say they fear for their lives. School leaders and residents are calling for urgent intervention to restore security and basic services so teaching and learning can continue.

In accountability and state finances: investigators and prosecutors have continued to make headlines with asset preservation orders and freezes tied to alleged corruption. The Special Investigating Unit secured a preservation order on a luxury property and vehicle linked to an Eskom tender probe, and the SIU has won major court actions this year that the judiciary and commentators say are important victories for recovering ill‑gotten gains. Reports this week say an Eskom employee is accused of stealing millions to build a luxury home, and the SIU and other agencies have moved to freeze assets connected to these investigations. The cases underline both the scale of alleged misconduct in some state procurement and the push by investigative bodies to prevent suspects from enjoying proceeds while cases proceed.

In economic policy: Treasury has been active in markets, raising funds for infrastructure. Officials successfully launched and raised eleven point eight billion rand through the country’s first Infrastructure and Development Finance Bond. The move is framed as part of a broader effort to finance public investment and support economic projects that can stimulate jobs and growth. Observers note that tapping capital markets for long‑term infrastructure is a priority as South Africa seeks to rebuild public confidence and crowd in private investment.

A heads‑up on banking and consumers: after a long, difficult year for depositors, the Ithala Bank saga has a development families will notice this festive season. Deposit holders at the institution—numbering around two hundred and seventy thousand—have finally received payments, bringing relief to many who endured prolonged uncertainty while legal battles continued. The payout will be a welcome boost for households preparing for the holidays.

And finally, on social issues: a new People Living with HIV Stigma Index report shows discrimination persists in homes, workplaces and healthcare settings, even though some progress has been made over the past decade. The findings warn that stigma continues to shut people out from jobs, family life and access to services, and they reinforce calls for sustained public education, supportive workplace policies and strengthened protections to ensure people living with HIV are not marginalised.
