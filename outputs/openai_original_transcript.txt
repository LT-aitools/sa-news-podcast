First up, in business news: Aspen Pharmacare has agreed to sell major Asia Pacific assets in a deal worth twenty six billion five hundred million rand. The company says the disposal was not planned, but that an unsolicited offer from Australian firm BGH Capital was considered strong enough to accept. Aspen will sell its Asia Pacific operations, excluding China, in a transaction valued at A$2.37 billion, which the company reports will be used to reduce group debt. The deal has produced a sharp market reaction, with reports that Aspen shares jumped significantly on the news. Company statements emphasise this was a binding offer the board felt was in the best interests of the business given the unsolicited nature of the proposal. That is a major move for one of South Africa's largest pharmaceutical manufacturers as it looks to strengthen its balance sheet heading into the new year.

In infrastructure and municipal services: a fourth substation fire this year has left large parts of the City of Tshwane without power and raised new red flags over the state of the city's electricity network. City officials are defending the integrity of the grid and say restoration work is under way, with progress reported at the Koedoespoort substation. At the same time, residents in some areas have been without electricity for several days, prompting questions about resource constraints and potential vandalism. Local authorities have deployed teams to secure and repair damaged infrastructure, and the municipality says it is working through the festive season to restore supply. The repeated incidents at multiple substations this year have renewed calls for a swift and transparent plan to improve resilience, protect critical assets and keep vulnerable communities powered, especially as many services and small businesses rely on consistent electricity during the holiday period.

Now to Cape Town, where cultural heritage and the law have collided. An association representing aspects of the Kaapse Klopse, commonly known as the minstrel parade, has taken the City of Cape Town to court over a proposed change to the parade venue. The group argues its living heritage is under threat as the city considers re-routing the traditional Tweede Nuwe Jaar parade away from its historic paths. The dispute has drawn broader attention, with the African National Congress in the Western Cape reportedly also challenging the venue decision in court. Supporters of keeping the original route say the parade is more than an event; it is a cultural practice and a form of living resistance with deep historical roots. City officials have explored alternative routes such as Green Point, arguing changes could transform the event and address logistical concerns. The court case will test how municipal planning decisions balance safety, access and the preservation of intangible cultural heritage.

In defence and security news: remains believed to belong to a South African National Defence Force member have been found, bringing a tragic patrol search to a close for families and colleagues. The missing soldier had been swept away during a Christmas day patrol, triggering a multi-agency search operation and the deployment of additional resources. Authorities confirmed that remains thought to be those of the missing servicemember were recovered after concerted search efforts. The SANDF had earlier reported one soldier dead and another missing following the patrol incident, and the recovery marks a somber development in that ongoing investigation. Military and civilian agencies involved in the search continue to support affected families and to probe the circumstances that led to the incident.

A quick safety and weather note before we close: the national forecast is warning of severe thunderstorms in many parts of the country, with above-normal rainfall expected through the interior provinces as we move into the new year. The minister of cooperative governance and other authorities have urged heightened vigilance, particularly where flood risks are elevated over the holiday period. Residents are being asked to monitor local alerts and to take precautions as required.
