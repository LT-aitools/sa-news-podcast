Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Saturday, the third of January, two thousand and twenty-six.

First up: a shocking assault in the Eastern Cape that has gone viral and left a security guard and a community reeling. Video circulating online shows a brutal attack on security guard Xolisile Nongodlwana in East London. Two people have been arrested in connection with the incident, and the footage has prompted swift consequences. A major mining company has barred a contractor after the clip surfaced, and reports say the suspect faces not only criminal charges but also the possible loss of livelihood. Nongodlwana and other security workers have spoken out, and the story has sparked national anger about violence targeting frontline workers. We will follow developments as police investigations and employer actions continue.

In local safety and rescue news: search and recovery operations intensified after several mass drowning incidents reported over the New Year period, and separate tragedies have unfolded in Limpopo. On the KwaZulu-Natal coast emergency services and rescue groups reported multiple drownings and missing swimmers at beaches, including Pennington and Thompson’s Bay near Ballito, as thousands of holidaymakers took to the water on New Year’s Day. Rescue organisations and lifeguards were praised for action that saved many, but search teams continued looking for those still missing.

Separately, in Limpopo, a South African National Defence Force woman drowned when a vehicle she and others were travelling in was swept away by floodwater. Police in Polokwane have opened an inquest and an investigation was launched after the vehicle was swept away. Authorities recovered the body attached to the SANDF member and search operations in some areas, including Komatipoort and parts of Mpumalanga where personnel went missing, have been officially called off after exhaustive efforts. These incidents underline ongoing risks from strong currents and flood conditions during the holiday period and the continuing strain on search-and-rescue teams.

In public health and environment: health authorities are warning people not to eat shellfish along parts of the West Coast after a red tide event. Officials have issued a clear public warning to avoid white mussels and other shellfish washed ashore, saying they are unsafe for consumption. The red tide has hit beaches along the Cape West Coast, prompting fisheries and health departments to urge caution. The advisory is straightforward: do not harvest or eat shellfish from affected areas until authorities confirm it is safe. Local media and emergency services are relaying updates as monitoring continues.

In economic news: the rand and local markets have started the year on a surprisingly strong footing. Reports say the South African currency has hit its strongest level since two thousand and twenty-two, a move analysts link to domestic economic reforms and a rally in metals prices. The Johannesburg Stock Exchange recorded a very strong session, with gold and platinum stocks among the top performers, and commentators have noted that markets and bonds recorded solid gains in twenty twenty-five despite a slow economy and high unemployment. Observers emphasise the disconnect between upbeat financial markets and the broader challenges facing the economy, but for investors the new year began with notable momentum.

A final brief item: a new report on HIV stigma has been released to guide South Africa’s fight against discrimination. The report aims to inform policy and public health responses to stigma and shape efforts to support people living with HIV, reinforcing the continued national priority of tackling discrimination and improving access to care.

That is the Mzansi Lowdown for today.

That is all for today,
