Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Tuesday, the eighteenth of November, two thousand and twenty-five.

First up: the G20 summit in Johannesburg. South Africa is hosting the leaders’ meeting later this week with participation confirmed from forty-two countries and organisations, and government ministers stress the summit will go ahead despite some high-profile absences. The minister of international relations and co-operation says the non-attendance by some leaders is not a snub, and officials are emphasising that the show will go on. Authorities across Gauteng have warned of major road closures affecting Johannesburg, Tshwane and Ekurhuleni as security and logistics preparations ramp up. The provincial administration says joint operations are in place and residents should expect traffic disruptions around key venues. At the same time, organisers and business leaders are framing the event as an economic opportunity, with provincial officials suggesting the presidency could pull billions of rand into the local economy. Protests are also planned. The group Operation Dudula has signalled intentions to demonstrate while leaders are in the city, underscoring the security and crowd-management challenges authorities face this week.

In diplomatic and political fallout closer to home: attention remains on an unfolding controversy over sudden flights carrying Palestinians to South Africa. More than one hundred and fifty people arrived on chartered flights recently, and the government is investigating what it calls alleged forced migration and the circumstances of those arrivals. The minister of international relations has described the case as suspicious and has ordered inquiries. Reports have emerged that some of the passengers say they paid amounts equivalent to thirty-four thousand rand per seat to travel, and media investigations are probing who organised the flights and whether any trafficking or irregular recruitment took place. The story has attracted scrutiny from several news outlets and prompted questions about the role of private organisers and any potential exploitation of vulnerable people seeking refuge. The department is pursuing answers and has said it will look into any shady arrangements behind the charter flights.

Turning now to domestic accountability: the Madlanga commission of inquiry continues its hearings into corruption, criminality and political interference in the criminal justice system. The commission has moved into a new phase in which implicated individuals will testify. Brown Mogotsi, named by investigators as an alleged middleman in payments linked to a suspended minister and an alleged crime cartel member, is scheduled to take the stand. Earlier testimony at the commission revealed serious problems in the handover of the Political Killings Task Team dockets — one witness described the transfer of one hundred and twenty-one files to national headquarters as messy and poorly prepared. Senior police officials have told the commission that some of those dockets sat idle in Pretoria and contained discrepancies, and that the disbandment of the task team was abrupt. The hearings continue and are likely to probe both operational failures and the chain of decisions that disrupted investigations into political killings.

In political management and party business: the African National Congress has signalled a significant change to its approach for the local government elections next year. The party will announce its mayoral candidates for metropolitan municipalities before the polls, a break with tradition. Internal guidelines specify that a large proportion of nominees should have prior experience in government, and party officials say selections will come from senior ranks, including current and former ministers and business leaders. The move is being presented as an attempt to improve certainty for voters and to strengthen the ANC’s slate in key metros ahead of what promises to be a closely contested election season.

Economic headlines today show cautious optimism. Credit agencies and markets are reacting to policy moves and signs of reform. South Africa has seen its bond yields fall and an upgrade from one major ratings agency after years without improvement, and financial commentators say this reflects growing confidence in fiscal management. Economists are welcoming the upgrade while also warning against complacency, noting that long-term stability still depends on sustained growth, fiscal discipline and structural reform. Officials are framing the momentum as an opportunity to attract investment as the country hosts the G20 and highlights policy progress to the international community.

And finally, justice and governance: the controversy over recent ministerial changes continues to ripple through public debates. Media analysis is asking whether South Africa can maintain influence at global forums when portfolios change during critical summits, and commentators note the potential impact on climate diplomacy after an environment minister was removed from office while important conferences were under way. Political leaders and analysts are watching closely to see how these personnel shifts affect South Africa’s standing in international negotiations.

That is the Mzansi Lowdown for today. That is all for today,
