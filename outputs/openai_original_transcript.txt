Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is the first of November, two thousand and twenty-five, South African Standard Time.

First up, accountability and explosive testimony at the Madlanga Commission and Parliament’s police inquiry. Witness material and leaked audio have once again put alleged corruption and political interference under the microscope. Vusimuzi “Cat” Matlala has featured heavily in the week’s hearings — not in person, but through comments attributed to him — claiming that he paid large sums to senior politicians and top police officials in return for favourable contracts and influence. That allegation, if proven, underscores long-standing concerns about pay-to-play networks inside state institutions.

Parliament’s ad hoc committee also heard from Lieutenant General Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi, whose testimony pointed to systemic corruption and political interference inside the South African Police Service and the justice system. The committee highlighted worrying questions about the allocation of responsibilities in senior posts: it reported that the deputy police commissioner has been in office for more than a year without formal duties assigned. Witness C continued to give testimony and the commission heard further detail about Matlala’s purported claims. Riah Phiyega has publicly denied meeting Cat Matlala and is seeking to clear the air amid the swirl of accusations.

The hearings have not only exposed alleged wrongdoing; they are raising questions about the safety of witnesses and the capacity of oversight bodies to act. Public interest has been keen, but coverage patterns suggest social media influencers and alternative channels are playing a significant role in keeping this story alive. Expect the Commission and Parliament to remain focal points in coming weeks as further testimony and possible criminal referrals are assessed.

In municipal news, the battle for Johannesburg’s streets intensified this week as the City pressed ahead with a crackdown on noncompliant informal traders. Mayor Dada Morero has defended the removals as an effort to restore law and order in the central business district, but traders and advocacy groups are fighting back.

Many evicted informal traders have warned that their families face starvation if they lose their livelihoods. Groups including the Socio-Economic Rights Institute have taken the matter to court, challenging the City’s actions and arguing for protection of small-scale traders who depend on street trading to survive. The dispute gets at broader tensions: the City says it is enforcing bylaws and attempting to maintain order in public spaces; traders and rights groups say enforcement is heavy-handed and fails to consider the economic vulnerability of the informal sector.

Court proceedings are now under way and legal rights to trade, the nature of enforcement, and the City’s plans for the urban economy will be tested in public. This is a story that affects ordinary livelihoods across Johannesburg and poses a broader policy question for metros nationwide: how to balance regulation, public order and the protection of informal livelihoods.

Next, a major corporate governance and education story: shareholders of Curro, South Africa’s largest private school group, approved a transformation that will see the company become a nonprofit. The deal is a charitable buyout worth seven point two billion rand, arranged by a foundation set up by PSG founder Jannie Mouton. Shareholders gave overwhelming approval to the move on Friday.

The decision marks the end of an era for the country’s biggest private school operator and will have implications for parents, staff and investors. Coverage notes that this will change Curro’s corporate structure and may affect how the group is governed and financed going forward. As the sector adjusts, commentators will be watching whether the nonprofit model reshapes private schooling access, fees and investment in infrastructure.

And in national policy, the Presidency has flagged slow progress on electricity reforms as a notable concern. Government monitoring indicates that planned reforms intended to address the electricity crisis have not moved at the pace originally outlined. Operation Vulindlela, the interdepartmental initiative aimed at implementing structural reforms, is continuing into Phase Two, but the Presidency is insisting that more speed is required to stabilise supply and improve investment confidence.

The slow pace of electricity reform persists as a major economic and social problem. Businesses and households alike bear the strain of unreliable power, and the Presidency’s intervention signals a renewed focus on overcoming bureaucratic and regulatory bottlenecks. Engineering News and other outlets note that some progress is being made under Operation Vulindlela, but the message from the Presidency is clear: acceleration is required if South Africa is to meet both short-term needs and long-term energy security goals.

Before we go: mental health in the education system is also drawing attention. The South African Council for Educators has commissioned a probe into teacher workloads and burnout after numerous complaints about fatigue and emotional strain. That investigation will seek to identify systemic causes and potential remedies to support teacher wellbeing.

That is the Mzansi Lowdown for today. That is all for today.
