Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is twenty first December two thousand and twenty five. Here are the top stories.

First up: a deadly tavern attack in the West Rand. Reports from multiple outlets say gunmen opened fire at a tavern in Bekkersdal, killing people and leaving the community in shock. Local coverage, including News24 and TimesLive, says nine people were killed in the mass shooting. International outlets carrying the story reported similar figures, with some citing as many as ten fatalities. Authorities have not yet released a full motive, and investigations are under way. Communities and emergency services are reporting trauma and grief, and national leaders have been urged to offer support to victims’ families. We will continue to watch official updates as investigators piece together what happened and who is responsible.

In national governance news: the National Prosecuting Authority has quietly settled a high-profile dispute with a former Hawks boss. News24 reports that the NPA paid out millions of rand in a secret settlement with the former head of the Hawks. Details remain limited in public reporting: the payment and the terms were not disclosed broadly, and the story raises questions about transparency and accountability in prosecutions and leadership disputes within law enforcement structures. The settlement follows years of controversy around leadership of specialised units, and this development is likely to prompt renewed calls for clarity from oversight bodies and from Parliament. The New NPA stance will be watched closely by civil society and political commentators who have repeatedly demanded stronger transparency in how taxpayer funds are used in sensitive prosecutions and employment disputes.

Next: a new deputy trade minister has signalled a shift in foreign policy priorities and domestic economic measures. News24 reports that the incoming deputy trade minister has publicly taken aim at relations with the United States while also criticising the Transformation Fund. The minister’s comments suggest a tougher, more recalibrated approach to trade diplomacy with Washington and a scrutiny of the mechanisms intended to drive transformation in the economy. Details published in the piece indicate the deputy minister will press for policies that align trade strategy with broader transformation objectives, and may revisit existing bilateral engagements. The remarks come as South Africa navigates complicated international trade relationships and seeks to ensure that domestic transformation goals remain central to economic policy. How this posture will affect trade negotiations or investment remains to be seen, but it signals a more assertive tone from the Department of Trade.

Political watch: a document reported by the Sunday Times and picked up by TimesLive reveals that the Democratic Alliance drew up a plan to bring Starlink, the satellite internet company associated with Elon Musk, into the South African market under a prospective DA-led government. The piece says the submission was confidential and prepared before the election. It outlines a policy pathway for introducing private satellite broadband services to increase connectivity. The story has prompted debate about telecommunications policy, the role of private tech vendors in national infrastructure, and the political optics of aligning with a high-profile international company. Supporters argue that new technologies could improve access in underserved areas; critics raise questions about regulatory oversight, national security and public control of critical communications infrastructure.

A developing mystery involving the South African Air Force has also drawn attention. News24 has published reporting on an air force aircraft operating near Mauritius under circumstances described as unclear. The report asks what the aircraft is looking for and notes that authorities have not provided a full explanation. The operation has prompted speculation and questions about regional cooperation, search and rescue activity, and the scope of South Africa’s military and humanitarian missions in the Indian Ocean region. Officials have been asked for comment, and journalists are seeking clarity on whether the flight was part of a routine patrol, a search and rescue mission, or another operation that would involve coordination with Mauritian authorities.

Finally, an item touching on legal oversight: coverage in the Sunday Times and other outlets highlights controversy at the Nkabinde inquiry, where the National Director of Public Prosecutions took the extraordinary step of refusing to answer questions until she had obtained legal advice. The move has sparked debate about accountability and the legacy of prosecutorial leadership. Commentators say the decision raises questions about how high-profile inquiries are managed and how the NPA balances legal risk with openness. Observers note that it is early days in the inquiry process, but the episode has already fuelled discussion about institutional independence and the standards expected of top legal officials.

That is the main news for today. Thank you for listening.

That is all for today,
