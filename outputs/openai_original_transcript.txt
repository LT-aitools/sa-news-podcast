Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Sunday, January eleventh, two thousand and twenty-six.

First up: a controversial change at the National Prosecuting Authority. President Cyril Ramaphosa has appointed Advocate Andy Mothibi as the new National Director of Public Prosecutions. The selection has already fuelled debate about transparency after a process that, according to reports, saw a ministerial-led panel conclude no candidate was suitable, and the President then made the appointment. Critics and commentators describe the process as confusing and flawed, and the new NDPP inherits an organisation that, editorial writers say, faces low public confidence and a mountain of work to restore trust. Outgoing NPA head Shamila Batohi was praised by the President for having transformed and repositioned the NPA, but observers warn the next director will have to prove he can be a tough sheriff against corruption. Expect scrutiny in the weeks ahead as Mothibi settles into the role and faces calls to demonstrate independence and transparency.

In political news: tensions are rising within the governing alliance as the South African Communist Party signals it may contest elections independently and has made clear it wants a bigger role in government. The SACP says it wants to enter government to help the African National Congress accelerate land reform and economic redistribution. That stance has deepened strains at the January eighth anniversary events, where President Ramaphosa addressed supporters at Moruleng stadium and urged renewal within the ANC. The SACP general secretary Solly Mapaila snubbed the rally, underlining the fissures. Locally, some ANC anniversary events drew criticism from residents who said celebrations felt like they were taking place while people suffer. The political scene is watching whether these alliance tensions translate into policy shifts or electoral realignments as the year unfolds.

Now to allegations of corruption at one of the country’s biggest asset managers. The Public Investment Corporation is facing bribery and corruption allegations after a botched loan deal worth seven hundred million rand to property tycoon Ralebala Mampuele collapsed when a cash advance was declined. The fallout has prompted reporting that the transaction exposed questionable practices and has raised fresh concerns about governance at the PIC. The story is developing, and authorities and watchdogs are expected to look more closely at how such large transactions were handled and whether proper safeguards were in place to protect public funds.

Education continues to be a major headache in Gauteng as the new school year gets under way. Investigations and reporting reveal that Gauteng lost one billion rand on unfinished school projects. As pupils return to classrooms, only two new schools are set to be handed over to the provincial education department — one project that began a decade ago and another that should have been completed five years ago. The backlog and unfinished infrastructure underline problems with planning, procurement and oversight in the education sector. Separately, there is continued fallout from a matric cheating scandal. Basic Education Minister Siviwe Gwarube said the department’s national investigation task team identified a human resources employee, whose son wrote matric, as one of the sources behind leaky exam material. The combined issues — incomplete school builds and examination integrity concerns — are heightening pressure on the education department to fix governance failures quickly.

Turning to party politics beyond the ANC: the Democratic Alliance is experiencing a bitter internal row that has escalated publicly. The dispute has reached a new level with Dion George, a recently axed environment minister, taking the unprecedented step of reporting party leader John Steenhuisen to the Public Protector. Observers describe the situation as an open war inside the DA, with factional fights and personal grievances playing out in public. The party will need to manage these divisions if it is to present a united front in the coming local election cycle.

A local governance note from eThekwini: Durban authorities are preparing to unveil towering statues of former ANC presidents Oliver Reginald Tambo and Nelson Mandela. The statues have reportedly stood shrouded in the city for months as planning for a formal unveiling now moves ahead. This is part of a wider pattern of high-profile symbolic gestures coinciding with the ANC’s anniversary events across the country.

And finally a quick media and communications update: a clash has emerged inside the Department of Social Development between current minister Sisisi Tolashe and her predecessor Lindiwe Zulu over an in-house communications channel called DSDTV. The channel is claimed by some within the department to have saved millions of rand, and the dispute points to broader battles over control of departmental communications and resources.

That is the Mzansi Lowdown for today.

That is all for today,
