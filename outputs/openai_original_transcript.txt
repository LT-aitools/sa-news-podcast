Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is the seventeenth of November, two thousand twenty five.

First up: the G20 in Johannesburg. South Africa prepares to host the summit from the twenty second to the twenty third of November, but the leaders gathering will be smaller and the business of the meeting is already under pressure. The United States has made clear that it will oppose a G20 Johannesburg Leaders' Declaration, signalling it will resist signing a broad joint statement. That stance follows a row over attendance, with the United States declining to send its leader and other high-profile leaders also choosing lower-level representation. South African officials, including President Ramaphosa, say the summit will go on and that South Africa will not pander to the United States, but analysts now expect a weaker outcome document — more likely a Chair's Statement than a fully negotiated Leaders' Declaration. Civil society groups have mobilised in parallel, launching a "People's Summit" in Johannesburg calling for climate justice, debt relief, and a tax focus on the richest. With the United States signaling opposition and a string of leader absences, South Africa faces a diplomatic test: to run a successful African-hosted G20 in a context where global power dynamics are fragmenting.

Next: the mystery of the Palestinian flights to Johannesburg. In the past three weeks two chartered flights carrying Palestinians fleeing Gaza landed at OR Tambo International Airport. What followed left authorities facing a conundrum. Reports describe the arrivals as puzzling and have prompted questions about who organised the flights, what papers were issued, and whether those on board arrived voluntarily. Some media accounts report allegations that some of the arrivals may have been forced or coerced, and Israeli officials say the Gazans had been granted entry. South African authorities are under pressure to explain how more than three hundred people arrived on what some outlets call "mystery planes." Daily Maverick and other outlets have been tracking the story, noting that it is unfolding behind the scenes and raising concerns about migration, human rights, and the mechanics of international evacuations landing on South African soil.

In political developments at home: the continuing unraveling inside the uMkhonto Wesizwe party associated with former president Jacob Zuma. Eighteen months after securing fifty eight seats in Parliament and becoming the official opposition, the party is reported to be deep in debt and riddled with factionalism and chaos. Journalists describe internal warfare, financial strain, and leadership disputes that are hampering the party's ability to act as a cohesive opposition force. The breakdown is notable given the party's rapid rise in the last general election and raises questions about how parliamentary opposition dynamics will shift if the party cannot stabilise its internal structures.

Turning to energy and infrastructure: Eskom has announced ambitious transmission plans. The utility intends to build approximately fourteen thousand kilometres of new transmission lines in the coming years at an estimated cost of four hundred and forty billion rand. The proposal is part of broader moves in the energy sector, including nuclear ambitions and extension plans for existing plants, all aimed at stabilising the national grid and supporting future generation projects. The scale of the transmission programme would represent a major investment in South Africa's electricity backbone and comes as Eskom and the energy ministry signal intent to attract funding for large projects under the integrated resource plan framework. Officials say this build-out will be essential to connect new power generation and to reduce the frequency of load-shedding, but the plan also underscores the funding challenge and the long lead times required for large transmission projects.

A quick roundup of governance and accountability stories. The Special Investigating Unit and the Eastern Cape headline remain in tension after a high court ruling touched on the probe into Premier Oscar Mabuyane's academic credentials. The ANC in the province hailed what it called a court victory, but the SIU has said its investigation continues under an amended proclamation. In national accountability news, the Information Regulator ordered the South African Revenue Service to release former president Jacob Zuma's tax records — a rare glimpse of transparency insisted upon by news outlets and watchdogs. And in another accountability thread, reports surfaced of allegations against a former environment minister, including claims of bullying and sexual misconduct from staff, which the Democratic Alliance has confirmed were brought to party leadership attention.

Finally, a note on extreme weather risks. Gauteng was hit by a severe storm over the weekend described as Level Nine by some outlets, uprooting trees, flooding roads and causing power outages in neighbourhoods. Authorities downgraded some warnings but emergency and disaster teams remain on high alert after Amnesty International issued a report highlighting increasing flood risks in informal settlements. The storm and the report together underline persistent vulnerabilities in urban infrastructure and the urgency of climate adaptation planning at municipal level.

That is your Mzansi Lowdown for today.

That is all for today,
