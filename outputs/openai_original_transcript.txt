First up: politics and a high-profile resignation. Duduzile Zuma-Sambudla has resigned as a Member of Parliament. The move follows allegations linked to the so-called MK-Russia matter, where she is accused of duping party members into travelling to fight for Russia. The resignation was confirmed by party officials and has dominated coverage across several outlets today. The MK Party says the resignation is not an admission of guilt, and the party briefing saw Ms Zuma-Sambudla remain silent while questions swirled. Reporting also notes ongoing scrutiny around the fate of up to seventeen South Africans alleged to have been trafficked into the Ukraine conflict. Authorities and commentators are asking whether criminal liability can be pursued and how the matter will be handled legally. We will continue to follow any official statements and developments as they come.

In law and accountability news: the Madlanga Commission of Inquiry into political killings returned to the headlines this week. A senior police officer told the commission the disbandment of the KwaZulu-Natal Political Killings Task Team was “irrational, calculated”, testimony that has drawn sharp criticism of the decision to dismantle specialised units tackling political assassinations. The commission has focused attention on how docket management and alleged political interference may have affected investigations. The inquiry is expected to deliver a report in coming weeks, and panels convened to review suspicious authorisations have been put under the spotlight. The proceedings are a reminder of continuing concerns about the integrity of sensitive policing processes.

In crime news: the latest quarterly statistics show murders in South Africa have decreased slightly year on year, but the toll remains shockingly high. Between April and September this year the national average was sixty three murders per day. Police and criminal justice commentators welcomed the drop while warning that sixty three lives lost every day is unacceptable and that targeted interventions are still urgently required. Acting police leadership pointed to a notable decline in certain categories of violent crime, and officials said specialised programmes are beginning to make an impact in some areas. Still, the scale of fatal violence underlines the ongoing challenge for law enforcement and community safety strategies nationwide.

In economic and state enterprise news: Eskom has reported a half‑year profit of twenty four billion rand. Headlines today note the utility’s profitability, but companies and analysts caution that risks remain. Reporting says the profit comes amid a period in which load shedding has virtually vanished, prompting debate about whether the gains are sustainable and what it means for tariffs and the broader energy outlook. Government and business will be watching closely as Eskom balances revenue, debt servicing and the heavy operational demands of keeping the lights on for the country.

Turning to health and public policy: Deputy President Paul Mashatile will lead the official World AIDS Day commemoration in Limpopo on the first of December. The event comes as national campaigns push to maintain access to treatment and prevention services. In related health policy news, plans have been reported to introduce pre‑exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, in public hospitals next year. That move would expand access to an important HIV prevention tool through the public health system. Health officials and civil society are urging sustained treatment access and outreach ahead of World AIDS Day, stressing that prevention and continuity of care remain critical for progress.

A lighter local story to close today: a young cricketer from Benoni, Kearan‑Lee Weyers, is looking for support to advance his sporting career. The teenager has represented his school, Hoërskool Hans Moore, in the first team and competed at under‑eighteen interprovincial indoor and under‑seventeen Easter tournaments. With upcoming tournaments and tours on the horizon, funding is a barrier to his next steps. Supporters are being invited to donate so that he can play at national and international levels. It is one of those grassroots stories that shows how community backing can make a real difference to a young South African’s future.
