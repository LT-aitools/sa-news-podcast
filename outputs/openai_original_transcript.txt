First up: a tragic mass shooting in Reiger Park, Boksburg. A twenty nine‑year‑old father, Leòcant Joseph, died after shielding his one‑year‑old son during a drive‑by attack that left six people dead and three others wounded. When police arrived they found the child curled up beneath his father’s body. Local reports say the slaughter has laid bare severe resource shortages at the Reiger Park police station; its commander has warned the station operates with only two vehicles to serve a crime‑stricken area. Authorities have launched a manhunt for the suspected shooters as the province and grieving families seek answers and urgent action.

In policing and accountability news: the Auditor‑General has revealed irregular expenditure at the South African Police Service escalating to a headline figure of three point two billion rand. The audit found persistent non‑compliance with supply‑chain management rules and noted that two point five billion rand previously flagged for concern remains unresolved. The report raises questions about how tenders were awarded and points to failures in oversight as unsuited bidders continued to secure contracts. The revelations come as Parliament and oversight committees continue pressing the police to explain their procurement and spending practices.

Related oversight work is unfolding at the Madlanga Commission of Inquiry, which continues to probe allegations of criminality and political interference in the criminal justice system. This week the commission heard testimony that Hawks officials gave contradictory accounts about their response to the arrest of businessman Katiso Molefe. Witnesses have said officers were pressured in the lead‑up to the Molefe operation; one Hawks member claimed he was urged to “drive recklessly” to beat a schedule, while another described unnecessary delays. Crime intelligence boss Lieutenant‑General Dumisani Khumalo is also set to return to testify, as the commission pursues a fuller account of whether interference occurred and who may have been responsible. The hearings have repeatedly highlighted threats and heavy pressure faced by investigators in high‑profile cases.

In transport: questions are mounting over the future operator of the Gautrain as the Bombela Concession Company’s contract approaches its end. The Gautrain Management Agency has not yet selected a replacement operator despite plans to do so more than a year ago. Bombela, the consortium that built and has run the service, remains part of a bid for the next operating contract, but the delayed procurement process has left the clock ticking. Government and private bidders now face mounting pressure to conclude the selection so the network’s continuity is not jeopardised when the current concession lapses.

A consumer relief story: petrol prices will fall at the start of November. Fuel regulators confirmed a petrol price cut taking effect at midnight on Wednesday, with industry reports saying petrol will drop by fifty one cents per litre. Motorists across the country are expected to feel immediate relief at forecourts as officials implement the new price adjustments.

A brief political note: President Cyril Ramaphosa and leaders of the government of national unity concluded a two‑day strategic retreat over the weekend. They adopted a Medium‑Term Development Plan and reaffirmed a commitment to collaboration ahead of next year’s elections. Ramaphosa described the retreat as “exceptionally well” run and said the GNU is “here to stay,” signalling a desire for stability amid competing priorities.

And finally, a quick courts update out of Johannesburg: a high court judge has given the City of Johannesburg a two‑week deadline to verify, register and allocate trading stands to informal traders in the inner city. The ruling is aimed at speeding up permit allocations and addressing the long delays that have affected thousands of small traders who rely on street trade for their livelihoods.

That is the Mzansi Lowdown for today. That is all for today,
