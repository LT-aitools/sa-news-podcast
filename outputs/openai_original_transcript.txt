In legal and criminal justice news: News24 reports that a truck driver who has been accused in a fatal case is on the run after being granted bail, a development that has left grieving families furious. The families have slammed the justice system for allowing bail, saying the decision undermines their trust and denies them closure. The report highlights the tension between court decisions and community expectations in high‑profile cases, particularly when suspects do not remain in custody. Authorities are now seeking the driver, and families continue to demand stronger responses from the justice system.

Turning to road safety and the human cost of festive travel: multiple outlets report a spate of deadly crashes in Limpopo over the Christmas period. News24 says eleven people have been killed in three crashes since Christmas Eve, while IOL and SABC coverage focus on a head‑on collision on the N one that claimed two lives. Other reports detail collisions involving buses and trucks, and the death toll in some incidents rose as rescue and recovery efforts continued. Emergency services and provincial authorities have described major routes being closed and communities mourning multiple losses. These incidents form part of a tragic pattern of road fatalities this festive season, and they raise urgent questions about road safety enforcement, vehicle standards and emergency response on key national routes.

A violent incident in a Mpumalanga tavern has left a DJ dead and prompted fresh concerns about tavern safety and firearm violence. EWN and TimesLive report that a thirty three‑year‑old DJ was shot dead on Christmas Eve by a patron after the music was switched off; the patron then turned the gun on himself. The incident is being treated as a murder‑suicide and has prompted arrests and a police inquiry according to follow‑up reporting. Families and local communities have expressed shock at the senseless loss, and the case will feature in investigations into how tavern violence can be prevented.

And finally, a story of continued basic services failure: TimesLive reports that Hammanskraal marked another Christmas without running water after residents say they have been raising concerns for more than a decade. The report notes longstanding pleas for help from residents who say they have lost hope of ever receiving clean water from their taps. This is another example of persistent service delivery failures affecting everyday life for communities outside major urban centres, and it comes amid broader debates about municipal capacity, maintenance of infrastructure and government response to long‑term water crises.

A quick note on the business front: Daily Maverick’s year‑in‑review video looks back at South Africa’s business year, calling it one of optimism, drama and a late mini‑budget twist. The review traces how sentiment shifted through the year as economic debates and policy choices shaped the outlook for companies and households. For listeners tracking the economy, that summary offers context as authorities and markets head into the new year.

That is the news for this afternoon. Please stay safe on the roads and look out for each other during this holiday stretch.

That is all for today,
