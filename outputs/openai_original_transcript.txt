First up: developments at the Madlanga commission of inquiry. The commission, probing allegations of corruption and failures in the criminal justice system, heard evidence linking weapons across multiple high‑profile killings. An AK‑forty seven rifle that was confiscated in the murder investigation of engineer Armand Swart was reported to have been used in the shootings of musicians DJ Sumbody, DJ Vintos and Don Tindleni. Forensic testimony and ballistic links were discussed as the inquiry continues at the Brigitte Mabandla Justice College in Pretoria. The hearings have put renewed focus on police handling of ballistic evidence and on broader questions of trust in policing, with the commission still in session and further testimony expected.

Next: a serious criminal investigation in Pretoria. Police have apprehended a suspect in connection with the Mamelodi double murder. Authorities arrested a thirty eight‑year‑old man after two young women were found shot execution‑style on the side of the road, and a third victim was left for dead. The arrests followed community outrage and intense police work. The case has prompted national discussion about gender‑based violence, and public figures and activists have called for stronger measures to protect women and to hold perpetrators to account. The Mamelodi community and families of the victims are seeking answers as the criminal justice process moves forward.

The matter will proceed through the relevant legal channels, and Parliament’s committees continue to probe related issues across the criminal justice system.

Turning to education and child safety: Milnerton High School in Cape Town remains under scrutiny after alleged incidents of bullying came to light. The Western Cape Education Department has said Milnerton High followed due process when incidents were reported, but parents, learners and the public have demanded accountability and tangible safety reforms. A parent has publicly pleaded for compassion following the fallout, while the school announced a series of safety reforms and said it would implement measures to change the culture that allowed bullying to persist. Parliament’s oversight committee has also examined the school’s culture as part of wider concern about learner safety in education institutions. Authorities and school leaders say they are working to contain the issue and to prevent further harm.

In health news: South Africa has taken a major step in HIV prevention by approving a long‑acting anti‑HIV injection, described in reports as a twice‑a‑year jab. The approval makes South Africa the first country on the African continent to register this new product, which regulators and health experts say is designed to curb new infections and expand prevention options. Reporting indicates that the injection, identified in official notices, will arrive in November, and that registration proceeded at record speed. Health authorities and campaigners have framed the move as an important addition to prevention tools, while implementation plans and supply chain arrangements are expected to be announced ahead of the roll‑out.

The dual focus on prevention tools for HIV and renewed political leadership on TB underscores ongoing efforts to tackle infectious disease burdens in South Africa.
