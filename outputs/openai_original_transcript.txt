Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Monday, fifteenth December, two thousand and twenty five.

First up: politics. The African National Congress held its National General Council over the weekend and President Cyril Ramaphosa has been confirmed to lead the party’s campaign for the two thousand and twenty six local government elections. Coverage from the National General Council frames his leadership as pivoting on themes of renewal and the governing national unity arrangement as political wins. For now, reports say rumours of internal plotting have fizzled and would-be contenders appear calculated to wait for the outcome of next year’s municipal ballot. Analysts quoted in the coverage call Ramaphosa a skilful politician whose fate will largely be decided by voter response in the local government campaign next year. That will be the test that determines whether his claim of renewal resonates with communities on the ground.

In other political news: the appointment process for the director of public prosecutions continues to draw scrutiny. Commentators and legal analysts have described the National Prosecuting Authority appointment process as a disappointment from the outset. Coverage in several outlets highlights calls for greater parliamentary leadership and transparency around the selection of the next National Director of Public Prosecutions. Opinion pieces in the public domain are stressing why the office matters so much, and why a credible, independent NDPP is central to public trust in prosecutions. The debate has intensified after reporting that a high-profile NDPP hopeful was implicated in derailing the original arms deal investigation, a claim that has reignited concerns about past prosecutorial interventions. The broader narrative is that there is growing public demand for an appointment process that is accountable, visible to parliament and free from political interference.

Next: a major safety and tragedy story from KwaZulu‑Natal. Rescue and recovery teams have recovered a fifth body after the collapse of a four‑storey temple in Redcliffe, near Verulam, north of Durban. The incident on Friday prompted the establishment of a task team to probe the cause of the building collapse. Authorities and investigators are working to identify victims and to determine any failure in building standards or maintenance that could have contributed to this deadly collapse. The story is being followed by provincial and national responders as families seek answers and officials promise a full investigation into how a place of worship came to suffer such loss of life.

Turning to higher education: the minister of higher education has issued notices that could see the deregistration of a set of private institutions. Notices of intent to cancel registration have been issued for City Varsity and ICESA City Campus, and reporting indicates that Damelin is also facing possible cancellation over compliance failures. The notices follow government assessments that flagged failures to meet regulatory requirements. If the cancellations proceed, they would affect students, staff and the institutions’ ability to operate in the new academic year. Officials have framed the move as an enforcement of standards intended to protect students’ academic quality and financial contributions. The sector will be watching ministerial determinations closely and students are being advised to monitor official guidance.

A note on law enforcement oversight: separate reporting highlights lingering pressures on sidelined Police Minister Senzo Mchunu, amid ongoing hearings and allegations linked to the broader law‑enforcement scandal. Sources say a commission and parliamentary processes will produce reports this week that could increase scrutiny of various figures in the security services. The unfolding proceedings form part of a larger national conversation about capture, accountability and how to restore public confidence in policing institutions. We will follow the outcomes as they are released and any steps the Presidency or Parliament take in response.

Finally, a brief programme note for listeners: civil society and political commentators are urging more transparent processes across appointments, oversight and institutional regulation. From the NDPP selection to higher education registrations and investigations into deadly infrastructure failures, the common thread is public demand for accountability.

That is all for today.
