Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Monday, twenty second of December, two thousand and twenty five.

First up: a landmark court ruling that will reshape consumer finance in South Africa. The Supreme Court of Appeal has ruled that banks are legally liable for the second hand vehicles they choose to finance. The judgment means that when a bank agrees to finance a used car that turns out to be a lemon, the bank must carry the can. This is a significant shift in legal responsibility between consumers, dealers and financial institutions. The ruling is likely to have broad implications for vehicle-finance contracts, repossession procedures and consumer-protection remedies. Consumers who bought cars on finance and later discovered major faults may now have a clearer path to hold the lender accountable. Financial institutions will need to review their underwriting, valuation and recovery practices in response to the judgment.

In breaking crime news: police investigations continue after a deadly mass shooting in Bekkersdal on the West Rand. Authorities say nine people were killed and ten were wounded in the attack at a local tavern in the early hours of Sunday. Among those killed was an e-hailing driver who had just dropped a client. The motive remains unknown. Police have launched a manhunt for the suspects, and the municipality has urged for additional security measures, including calls for army deployment. The scale and suddenness of the attack have prompted national concern, with law enforcement prioritising arrests and a wider search for answers.

Turning to a high-profile murder investigation in Johannesburg: the death of DJ Warrick Stock, known as DJ Warras, has prompted a multi-agency response. DJ Warras was shot dead at the Zambesi Building in the Johannesburg central business district. Police have identified a suspect linked to the killing and say that a known suspect will be arrested before Monday. There has also been controversy after a late-night raid at the Zambesi Building, with some city officials criticised for what has been described as a "reactionary" operation. National police leadership has indicated that arrests are imminent as detectives pursue leads, and the case remains a major focus for Gauteng policing.

Weather and flooding warnings now: heavy rain and storms swept parts of KwaZulu-Natal over the weekend, leaving sections of the South Coast under water. Local reports describe flash floods in Margate and Shelley Beach, with roads and tourist areas affected. Authorities have dispatched response teams and engineers to assess road conditions and ensure the safety of motorists and visitors. At the same time, national weather services have issued flood warnings as storms spread across the country on Monday, with a level five disruptive rain warning continuing for some regions and severe thunderstorm warnings in place. Gauteng also experienced severe thunderstorms that led to flooding in parts of Tshwane, and provincial reports confirmed roads and residential properties were disrupted. Emergency services and rescue teams responded to several incidents, including motorists requiring assistance and, tragically, bodies found near flooded rivers in areas such as Olievenhoutbosch in Pretoria.

In education news out of KwaZulu-Natal: the provincial education department has failed to place orders for textbooks for the coming school year. The failure to secure learning materials has prompted criticism from parents and education advocates who say "textbooks are not an optional extra." With the school year approaching, concerns are growing about learners being left without the essential resources they need. The issue adds pressure to an already strained education system at a time when tens of thousands of pupils in other provinces remain unplaced, and when holiday-time learning support is crucial for many families.

On the economic and diplomatic front: South Africa formally asked fellow G20 members to object to its exclusion by the United States from a recent G20 Sherpa meeting. Reports indicate that several G20 members privately objected to the United States excluding South Africa. Support for South Africa’s inclusion is said to come from countries including Germany and China, emphasising the importance of representation and diversity in G20 discussions. The matter has prompted debate about governance and inclusion at high-level global forums, and South Africa is challenging what it describes as unilateral decisions that affect its place in multilateral talks.

A quick social update from civil-society and relief efforts: Daily Maverick reporters covered community initiatives stepping up for children amid holiday hunger. Organisations including SA Harvest have been distributing food relief and buckets of nutrition to vulnerable families in Nelson Mandela Bay, aiming to restore dignity and ensure households can manage through the festive period. These community-run interventions are being highlighted as essential relief in the face of persistent food insecurity.

That is your Mzansi Lowdown for this Monday. That is all for today,
