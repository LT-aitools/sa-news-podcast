Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is two December twenty twenty five.

First up: the Madlanga commission of inquiry continues to dominate courtroom headlines. Former Ekurhuleni city manager Imogen Mashazi gave testimony this week about the controversial so-called blue lights saga. Mashazi denied she had tried to shield EMPD Brigadier Julius Mkhwanazi from scrutiny, but admitted she had failed to act when she received documents that set out allegations against him. The evidence presented to the commission includes documents from the Independent Police Investigative Directorate that, Mashazi said, made the accusations against Mkhwanazi look serious and deserving of investigation. The commission has also been told of wider failures in the metro: Mashazi is accused of not acting on allegations of sexual assault and corruption within Ekurhuleni metro police, and the hearings have at times become heated, with questions raised about her handling of WhatsApp records and phone calls. The Madlanga inquiry is expected to deliver an interim report to the President by mid-December and remains a focal point for accountability in municipal policing and procurement.

Next: an unfolding national security and criminal investigation over alleged recruitment of South Africans for the Russian military. Five suspects are now facing charges in court in connection with an alleged plot to recruit South Africans as mercenaries. Among those remanded is a prominent SAfm presenter, who, together with four others, has been linked in reporting to an alleged recruitment scheme. The Hawks have indicated they may not have finished their work: investigators have said more arrests remain possible and they are exploring links across provinces. News outlets are also parsing possible connections between separate cases, including high-profile figures who have been reported in the media in recent weeks. The developments put law enforcement under scrutiny as prosecutors and detectives try to untangle alleged recruitment networks and any cross-provincial ties.

In politics: internal ANC tensions and vocal backing for President Cyril Ramaphosa. Across the party, the ANC’s leagues have publicly rallied behind Mr Ramaphosa amid persistent murmurs that some groups want him removed ahead of the party’s national general council. The leagues’ show of support comes as Rumours of plots to recall the President have circulated, prompting party officials to say removal is not on the national general council agenda. At the same time, the Sunday press and other coverage suggest party structures will investigate claims of lobbying by former RET members seeking his resignation. The situation remains fluid but, for now, key ANC constituencies are issuing messages of unity and support for the President as internal debates continue.

Health and science brings a major World AIDS Day story. Deputy President Paul Mashatile this week led commemorations and announced plans for a breakthrough HIV prevention injection, with rollout scheduled for two thousand twenty six. The injections are being hailed as a significant prevention tool, and the government has set out ambitions for wider access. Separately, South African health commentators and government sources are discussing the possibility of local manufacture: officials say the country hopes to start making its own six-monthly HIV prevention jabs by two thousand twenty seven, using local pharmaceutical companies to produce generics and fill projected supply gaps as the nation pursues the goal of ending AIDS. But reporting highlights a hitch: there are logistical and regulatory issues to resolve before local production can begin. Officials have also warned about a separate, painful problem—more than one million people have fallen out of HIV treatment, a challenge the health system must confront even as prevention tools expand.

Weather and public safety: severe storms and unexpected hail this week have hit parts of Gauteng and neighbouring provinces. The South African Weather Service issued warnings about thunderstorms likely to bring heavy rain, damaging winds, excessive lightning and localised flooding, particularly for Gauteng, Limpopo and Mpumalanga. Residents in affected areas reported hail and overnight damage, with images and eyewitness accounts describing wide disruption. Authorities are urging people to stay indoors where possible and to take precautions as extreme weather is expected to intensify through December.
