Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Monday, the twelfth of January, two thousand and twenty-six.

First up: controversy in the arts. Sports, Arts and Culture Minister Gayton McKenzie has cancelled South Africa's submission to the Venice Biennale. The work in question reportedly alludes to what some describe as a genocide in Gaza. Critics say the minister's decision infringes on the right to freedom of expression. The cancellation has prompted accusations that government action is curbing artistic freedom, and that cultural institutions and artists have been denied a space for a politically charged work on the international stage. That is the lead line from reporting by Daily Maverick: an arts submission pulled at ministerial direction because of its provocative subject matter, and a debate now underway about censorship and the role of the state in cultural expression.

In national governance, President Cyril Ramaphosa has signalled a new push on municipalities. He has vowed decisive action in two thousand and twenty-six to revive failing local governments, saying that fixing local government is a priority for the African National Congress as it seeks to arrest voter decline. The president framed the restoration of municipal services as central to the party's strategy ahead of elections, and the promise is to act swiftly or face the consequences at the ballot box. Daily Maverick reports this as part of an ANC effort termed a municipal reboot, aimed at shoring up service delivery and stemming public disillusionment with local government.

Related to governance and oversight, the appointment of Andy Mothibi as head of the National Prosecuting Authority has provoked debate. Some business commentators welcomed Mothibi's appointment but said he must be equipped with resources to succeed. Others have warned the president's surprise move recalls past eras when executive power over prosecutorial appointments went largely unchecked. Daily Maverick published analysis describing the appointment as a curveball that exposes risky presidential power and has fuelled calls for greater transparency in appointments. The Democratic Alliance has taken the matter to court or filed applications seeking access to the report on the National Director of Public Prosecutions selection process, and there have been calls for stronger, more transparent procedures to prevent executive overreach. At the same time, commentators note expectations that Mothibi, with experience in the private sector and investigative units, must be supported to tackle corruption and restore confidence in the prosecuting authority.

In local politics, the Democratic Alliance's mayoral plans in Johannesburg are taking shape around veteran politician Helen Zille. Reports indicate Zille could join the metropolitan council as early as March, provided a proportional representative vacancy opens up following recent resignations and a by-election in Randburg. She says a friend persuaded her to stand, and she views this move as a first step toward a potential run for Johannesburg mayor before the municipal elections at the end of the year. The development points to a fast-tracked plan by the DA to position a high-profile candidate well ahead of the campaign season, and it raises questions about strategy, timing and the party's prospects in the country's largest city.

Turning to weather and the environment, Kruger National Park has been managing severe weather impacts. The park has evacuated camps after Level Six severe weather warnings affected Limpopo and Mpumalanga. Park officials relocated campers to less saturated areas and monitored conditions to ensure visitor safety as heavy rains hit the region. TimesLive also reported that two Kruger gates were closed following heavy rains, with staff relocating guests to reduce risk. This comes amid broader severe weather alerts across the province and underlines the ongoing challenges the park faces during extreme weather events, both for visitor safety and for conservation operations.

A quick note on education: the Independent Examinations Board reported a high pass rate for its Class of two thousand and twenty-five, with an overall pass rate of ninety eight point three one percent. The I.E.B. chief executive said standards were maintained and university access remained strong, with one hundred and sixty-one pupils achieving distinctions in all seven subjects. That is the I.E.B. picture ahead of national matriculant announcements later this month.

Finally, a brief item on public finances and scrutiny: there has been reporting and commentary about government travel expenses and transparency around appointments and spending. Some civic voices are pressing for clearer accounting and for presidential decisions, particularly on high-profile appointments, to be accompanied by full disclosure. These themes are running through coverage of the N.D.P.P. appointment, municipal promises and questions over public spending.

That is the main news for today.

That is all for today,
