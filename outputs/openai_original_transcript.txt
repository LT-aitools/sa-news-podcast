Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is the fifth of December, two thousand and twenty five.

First up: the Madlanga commission returned its glare to suspended national police matters. Justice Mbuyiseli Madlanga pressed suspended Police Minister Senzo Mchunu over the speed with which he disbanded the National Political Killings Task Team. Mchunu is facing tough questions after issuing the disbandment letter just three days after conceiving the plan, a timeline Madlanga described as “very strange.” Mchunu told the commission he believed the move had been in the pipeline and that this was his first chance to step back and reflect on his term. The hearings have also included testimony from Ekurhuleni metro police deputy chief Julius Mkhwanazi, who conceded he signed agreements linked to Matlala, and figures connected to the Matlala security company have featured in testimony. The unfolding inquiry is probing how senior law enforcement and political decisions were taken without wider consultation, and the commission continues to draw public and political scrutiny.

In national politics and foreign affairs: South Africa is in an awkward diplomatic spot with the United States over next year’s G20. Washington announced it will exclude South Africa from G20 activities under the American presidency, with suggestions from some quarters that Poland could take South Africa’s place. Pretoria’s response has been to characterise the move as a pause. The presidency said South Africa will “take a commercial break” from the summit while it assesses the situation and awaits what it called saner G20 waters. Deputy President Paul Mashatile has said the government still intends to attend the leaders’ summit, even as South Africa urges to be treated as an equal sovereign state. The exchanges have escalated into a broader diplomatic spat, with South Africa insisting on its position and saying it does not seek validation from Washington.

A major court ruling and renewed legal battle involving former president Jacob Zuma made headlines this week. A Gauteng High Court judge dismissed Zuma’s bid to appeal an order requiring him to repay twenty eight point nine million rand in taxpayer-funded legal defence costs incurred during his corruption trial. While that appeal was refused, the National Prosecuting Authority launched what it describes as a “Stop Stalingrad” application, aimed at preventing further delay tactics and pushing for the corruption trial to proceed without being stalled by repeated applications and appeals. The state told the court that Zuma’s defence has used procedural applications for nearly two decades, and it is seeking to bring a measure of finality so the case can move forward. Supporters of Zuma have continued to gather outside the court, and the legal battle is likely to remain a central story in the weeks ahead.

In public health: the World Health Organization warns of a worrying trend that has direct implications for South Africa and the region. Malaria-related deaths rose in twenty twenty four, and the WHO cautions that funding cuts could risk a resurgence. Reports note that the majority of the estimated six hundred and ten thousand people who died in two thousand and twenty one from malaria were in sub-Saharan Africa. The agency is sounding the alarm that reduced funding and weakening prevention programmes could drive higher mortality next year unless resources are restored and interventions scaled up. Health advocates and provincial authorities will be watching donor decisions closely as they plan responses for the high-risk season ahead.

Turning to the economy and industry: South Africa has opened its first new underground gold mine in fifteen years. The West Wits operation, just outside the City of Gold, has started production, signalling renewed investment and activity in a sector that has been quiet on new underground developments for more than a decade. The opening has drawn attention from industry and government as a symbol that mining can still attract capital and create jobs, even as the broader economy shows mixed signals. Elsewhere, there are reports that the rand strengthened through seventeen rand to the dollar as markets positioned for expectations of lower interest rates globally, and attention remains on investment flows and policy shifts that will influence growth next year.

A few quick headlines: the Gauteng education department reports that most Grade One and Grade Eight applicants have been placed for the two thousand and twenty six school year, but provinces are still scrambling to accommodate thousands of pupils. In local government, the DA has taken legal action over the appointment of senior managers in eThekwini, arguing the city appointed unsuitable and unqualified candidates; the municipality says it will oppose the court bid. And in Cape Town, authorities are warning the public to exercise caution around spring tides this weekend as the full moon brings stronger and less predictable tidal conditions.

That is all for today,
