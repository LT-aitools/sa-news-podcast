Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is six December two thousand twenty five. Here are the main stories we are following.

First up: a shocking attack related to the Madlanga Commission. A man known in coverage as Witness D, who had testified at the commission, was shot dead in front of his family. Multiple outlets report the killing and say it has sparked a manhunt and renewed concern for the safety of commission witnesses. Senior security officials are reported to be scrambling to protect other witnesses after what has been described as a targeted execution in Brakpan. Authorities have launched investigations and there are calls for urgent steps to ensure people who give evidence are kept safe. This comes as the commission continues its work and as other witnesses and officials remain under pressure. We will continue to watch for developments and any official statements from police and the commission.

In political accountability news: suspended Police Minister Senzo Mchunu was back before the Madlanga Commission and faced tough questioning about his decision to disband the National Political Killings Task Team, the PKTT. Commissioners pressed him on how quickly that decision was taken — one report said it was within days — and on whether he consulted senior South African Police Service leaders before acting. Mchunu told the commission the decision to dissolve the unit was prompted by multiple complaints against the task team, and he gave evidence to that effect. The hearing included live streams and intense exchanges, with the commission probing the speed and process of the disbandment and asking why consultation with policing leadership appeared to be lacking. The matter ties directly to ongoing concerns about political murders and how specialized investigations are managed.

In party politics in Gauteng: the African National Congress in Greater Johannesburg has a new regional chairperson. Loyiso Masuku was elected at the conference, unseating the sitting regional leader. Coverage notes that this marks an important leadership shift in the city region and that the ANC is grappling with structural challenges as opposition parties gain ground in parts of the metropolis, including Soweto. The win for Masuku also leaves Dada Morero remaining as mayor despite the conference defeat. Observers say the result will shape how the party manages local priorities, service delivery questions and the political dynamics in South Africa’s economic hub.

Turning to defence and foreign deployment issues: Members of Parliament and some ministers have publicly criticised the SANDF over conditions for soldiers deployed to the Democratic Republic of Congo. Reports say soldiers serving in the DRC have been forced to buy their own equipment. That charge prompted fresh scrutiny in parliament and a sharp rebuke from Deputy Defence Minister Bantu Holomisa, who scolded generals after a concise six-page report on foreign deployments was delivered to committee. Holomisa and other MPs described the briefing as inadequate. Media coverage shows concern over preparedness, logistics and transparency regarding South Africa’s external military involvements. The issue is now political as well as operational, with calls for clearer accountability for how deployments are resourced and managed.

Finally, a positive note from the environment: at Hartbeespoort Dam researchers and volunteers are fighting an invasive plant with tiny insects. A post-doctoral fellow from Rhodes University and colleagues are releasing the water hyacinth planthopper, Megamelus scutellaris, onto infestations every Thursday. The dam’s water hyacinth reportedly covers almost forty percent of the surface, and more than twenty thousand planthoppers are being used as a biological control to reduce the weed. The effort is local, methodical and community-driven, with the insects carefully packaged and released to feed on the hyacinth. It is a small-scale, science-led response that offers a hopeful example of practical ecological intervention in the face of invasive plant problems.

A quick roundup of other developments in the public interest: education infrastructure in Gauteng faces severe delays with projects not delivered, leaving learners in limbo; the Special Investigating Unit has obtained an order to freeze properties worth about eight point four million rand linked to an alleged personal protective equipment fraud probe in the Northern Cape; and the Presidency and ministers are continuing to navigate tensions with international partners as the country manages its G20 role and foreign policy debates.

That is our briefing for today.

That is all for today,
