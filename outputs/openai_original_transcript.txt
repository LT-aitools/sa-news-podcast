Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Monday, the first of December, two thousand and twenty five.

First up: politics and foreign relations. President Cyril Ramaphosa has publicly rebuffed recent claims by United States President Donald Trump that suggested racial persecution and other allegations against South Africa. Ramaphosa called those assertions “blatant misinformation” and urged South Africans not to spread falsehoods about the country to international partners. He also moved quickly to reassure citizens that, despite tensions and “challenges and misunderstandings” with the United States, South Africa remains a firm and unwavering friend to the American people and will participate in the G20 as a full, active and constructive member. The president held a last-minute family meeting on Sunday evening and addressed the nation to dismiss talk that South Africa could be excluded from next year’s G20 summit.

In national security reporting: the Hawks investigation into the recruitment of South Africans to fight in the Russia–Ukraine war continues to expand. Authorities have arrested a fifth suspect as part of the probe. The case has prompted other political fallout: Duduzile Zuma-Sambudla has resigned as a Member of Parliament after allegations she duped party members into supporting pro-Russia activity. Separately, testimony at the ongoing Madlanga Commission has raised fresh concerns about leaks and improper relationships between senior police officers and tenderpreneurs. KwaZulu-Natal Hawks head Major General Lesetja Senona has been implicated in accusations that he leaked sensitive police documents to businessman Vusimusi “Cat” Matlala. Senona’s testimony has been postponed after his lawyers argued they were prejudiced by not receiving evidence in time to prepare a full response.

Turning to local government and corruption concerns: a deepening probe into the brutal murder of Mpho Mafole, a chief municipal auditor in Ekurhuleni, suggests political interference. Reports indicate that Mayor Nkosindiphile Xhakaza may have tried to divert the police investigation away from the municipality’s award of a mobile chemical toilets tender — a contract worth approximately one point eight billion rand that had attracted attention for irregularities. At Mafole’s funeral, the mayor suggested the auditor might have been killed over other matters, but evidence shows municipal third-party audits documenting irregularities were already in place before Mafole’s employment. Investigators say Mafole had filed a scathing report criticising the chemical toilets tender three days before his killing, and critics are warning that efforts to steer attention elsewhere could undermine the integrity of the inquiry.

In environmental and disaster news: severe fires in the Western Cape have left hundreds homeless and caused fatalities. Relief group Gift of the Givers has mobilised to assist those affected after fires ripped through communities in and around Cape Town. One report noted that one person died and two firefighters were injured in the blaze that displaced roughly three hundred people in some areas, while other accounts say nearly two hundred structures were destroyed in Nomzamo, Strand. Authorities and civil society organisations are coordinating relief efforts as displaced families seek shelter and basic supplies.

Water management and infrastructure remain a live issue after heavy rains prompted the Department of Water and Sanitation to open ten sluice gates at the Vaal Dam. Officials issued warnings about downstream impacts and the need for residents and stakeholders to remain alert to changing water levels. Some reports described officials as “thrilled” that major dams are at record high levels, but they also emphasised ongoing management of releases to reduce flood risk. Local authorities continue to monitor the situation closely as communities downstream assess potential effects.

A brief governance note: concerns about public service performance and accountability have surfaced in multiple stories this morning, from Ekurhuleni’s financial management issues to broader questions raised at the Madlanga Commission. There is renewed attention on how tenders are awarded, on the protection of whistle-blowers and auditors, and on the conduct of senior officials in both municipal and national institutions.

Finally, a quick human-interest update to close: community action is visible in a range of local efforts — from heritage and tourism projects like the approved bid to bring back the Apple Express in Nelson Mandela Bay, to grassroots responses to crisis, including community relief in fire-affected areas. These developments reflect a mix of institutional strain and civic mobilisation as South Africa moves into the festive season.

That is all for today,
