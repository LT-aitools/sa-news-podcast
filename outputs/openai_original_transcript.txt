First up: explosive testimony at the Madlanga Commission is dominating headlines this weekend. Witness C continued testimony that has put fresh focus on allegations involving senior police figures and the suspended Police Minister. Reporting from IOL, Daily Maverick and the Sunday papers summarises a string of claims and counter‑claims heard in public hearings. Among the most striking allegations are claims by Vusimusi Cat Matlala, referenced in multiple accounts, that link funding for ANC celebrations to named officials. The evidence heard has forced politicians and police leaders to answer uncomfortable questions, and has prompted denials and rebuttals in turn. The suspended deputy national commissioner, Shadrack Sibiya, has accused police chiefs of creating a misleading impression of his role and his relationships with the people under investigation. He told the commission that testimony presented so far had distorted his position, according to the TimesLive and Sunday Times coverage. The unfolding hearings have also shown footage and accounts ranging from alleged cash exchanges to contested witness statements, and the commission’s proceedings continue to draw scrutiny as they probe how political money and policing intersect. We will follow developments as further testimony and potential referrals emerge from the commission.

In national politics: President Cyril Ramaphosa convened a private retreat with leaders of the governing national unity, or GNU, aimed at taking stock of the coalition. The meeting, reported by the Sunday Times and TimesLive, is described as a state of play pow‑wow and started today, running into tomorrow. Sources say the retreat is intended to manage tensions and map the future of the GNU amid a turbulent political climate. Details of the discussions are being kept close to the chest, but this is being framed as a high priority effort by the presidency to shore up the coalition and to plan next steps for governance. Expect statements and possible follow‑ups after the retreat concludes, as party leaders seek to resolve internal disputes and present a more coherent front ahead of a difficult political period.

Turning to the justice and diplomatic front: the Malawi High Court has overturned an earlier order to extradite Shepherd Bushiri and his wife Mary to South Africa, citing safety concerns, according to IOL and News24. The ruling means that the self‑proclaimed prophet and his wife will not be sent back to South Africa under the current order. South Africa’s Justice and Constitutional Development Minister has said officials are studying the judgment and the government is preparing its next move in response, as reported by TimesLive and EWN. The extradition question remains in legal and diplomatic limbo. South African authorities have indicated they will review the Malawian judgment and consider options available under international law and bilateral mechanisms. This remains an active matter between the two governments and will be watched closely for appeals or new legal steps.

A brief round of civic concerns: the Sunday papers continue to highlight growing service delivery stresses. Protesters in Johannesburg gathered over persistent water shortages, warning that residents are running out of water, power and patience, according to TimesLive and the Sunday Times. The demonstrations have put pressure on local authorities and underscore broader anxieties about municipal capacity ahead of the two thousand and twenty‑six local government elections. Separately, reporting in the Sunday Times flags a governance crisis in municipalities, with claims that hundreds of councillors are voting on budgets they cannot read. Those stories underline systemic governance challenges that affect everyday services.

Finally, a note on the economy and infrastructure: a Port of Gauteng developer has suggested restructuring highway tolls when the N3 concession expires in two thousand and twenty‑nine, so that rail corridors can get a share of toll revenue to improve freight efficiency, according to the Sunday Times and TimesLive. The proposal feeds into broader debates about freight logistics and how to shift more cargo to rail, but it will require policy decisions and coordination between transport authorities and the private sector.

That is the main news for today. That is all for today,
