Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Monday, the twenty ninth of December, two thousand and twenty five.

First up: a government probe into a deadly building collapse in Soweto. Public Works and Infrastructure Minister Dean Macpherson has ordered the Council for the Built Environment to launch an immediate investigation after a structural collapse in Doornkop that claimed three lives in the early hours of Sunday. Emergency services confirm a double-storey structure gave way, and the deaths included a child and two women, according to reporting from the scene. The minister has moved quickly to trigger a formal inquiry into how the building was allowed to collapse and whether regulatory or maintenance failures contributed. This is breaking and deeply worrying for families in the area, and authorities say they will pursue the facts as the investigation gets under way.

Next: a major story on the state-owned logistics sector. Transnet, the national port operator, began a road to recovery during two thousand and twenty five. Reporting traces how the organisation started to stabilise operations at key ports, laying the groundwork for improved cargo flow and reducing the crippling disruption that affected trade in previous years. The recovery effort in two thousand and twenty five focused on operational fixes, infrastructure maintenance and restoring confidence among shipping customers. Analysts note that while progress has been made, the work is ongoing and the next phase will require continued investment and stronger coordination to ensure ports can handle the demand of South Africa's export and import economy. For businesses and exporters, any improvement at Transnet is closely watched because it affects jobs, supply chains and the cost of doing business across the country.

In national politics and public administration: Social Development quietly removes an inexperienced twenty two‑year‑old from a senior post after mounting criticism. Minister Sisisi Tolashe reversed a controversial appointment that drew attention for the appointee's lack of qualifications and experience. The young appointee, Lesedi Mabiletja, has been relieved of the role of chief of staff but remains employed within the department in a position for which reporting suggests she is still unqualified. The move has not satisfied critics who say the original appointment demonstrated poor judgement and highlighted weaknesses in how senior public service roles are filled. Questions remain about internal processes and oversight as calls grow for clearer standards on appointments to senior government offices.

Turning now to conservation and tragic news abroad involving South Africans. Vincent van der Merwe, a globally renowned conservationist and National Geographic Explorer, has died. He was found dead in his apartment in Riyadh. Van der Merwe was known for his work organising the transfer of cheetahs to India and for his leading role in cheetah conservation. Authorities have said no foul play is suspected. The conservation community has expressed shock and sorrow at the loss of a prominent South African scientist whose work crossed continents and whose efforts shaped international wildlife conservation initiatives.

Also in foreign postings: France is investigating the death of South Africa's ambassador to France, Nathi Mthethwa. The former Cabinet minister died at the age of fifty eight; French authorities reported no signs of a struggle in his twenty second‑floor hotel room. Colleagues and friends are in mourning while investigators continue to establish the circumstances surrounding his death. The South African diplomatic community has paid tribute to his service, and the incident is being handled by local French authorities as they provide details to Pretoria.

A few other items to close today’s bulletin: independent reporting has continued into allegations around the suspended IDT chief executive, and broader discussions about accountability in public appointments remain on the national agenda as the year turns. Meanwhile, weather services are warning Gauteng and Limpopo of heavy downpours and thunderstorms up to New Year’s Eve — something that will concern families and municipalities responding to infrastructure and flood risks during the holidays.

That is the Mzansi Lowdown for today.

That is all for today,
