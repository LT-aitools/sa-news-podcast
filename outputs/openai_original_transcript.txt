Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is the twenty second of November, twenty twenty five. Here are the stories you need to know.

First up: the G20 Leaders’ Summit in Johannesburg. World leaders have arrived and South Africa is at the centre of international attention as it hosts the summit at Nasrec. The gathering has been marked by high-profile absences and diplomatic friction — most notably the United States. President Cyril Ramaphosa has reportedly stood firm and rejected a late request from Washington to hand over responsibility for the summit to a lower-level delegation, a move that underlines growing tensions between Pretoria and Washington over how the meeting should be handled. Officials in Pretoria have conveyed displeasure at what they call an eleventh-hour change in posture by the United States.

Despite that tension, South Africa has been pushing for a substantive outcome. Sherpas and negotiators worked through the night to salvage a leaders’ declaration, with reports suggesting a tentative agreement was achieved after all-night talks. The summit is also drawing praise from global figures: United Nations secretary-general António Guterres commended South Africa’s G20 theme and urged urgent action on global inequalities and support for developing nations. European Union leaders were present and used the platform to advance cooperation.

On the economic front tied to the summit, the European Union announced new commitments to South Africa. The EU has pledged seven hundred and fifty million euros in fresh investments aimed at modernising transport and energy infrastructure and signed an agreement to jointly develop critical minerals with South Africa, signalling deeper strategic ties on supply chains and industrial development. British and other partners are also reportedly using the summit to announce investment pledges and development packages.

A dramatic development at the funding level came as the Global Fund replenishment took place alongside the summit. The United States stunned attendees with a pledge of four point six billion dollars to the Global Fund, even as diplomatic relations with South Africa are strained by summit-level disagreements. South African government and business leaders have themselves pledged commitments to the fund, though those contributions are far smaller than the U.S. announcement.

This summit is being treated as a test of South Africa’s diplomatic clout: whether it can secure meaningful agreements on trade, climate and development while managing a complex geopolitical row with its largest partner. Expect continuing headlines as leaders move in and negotiations play out.

In domestic policy news: gender-based violence and femicide has been officially declared a national disaster. Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Velenkosini Hlabisa confirmed the designation, which places the crisis within a framework that requires intensified prevention, scaled-up support services and co-ordinated long-term interventions across national, provincial and local government.

The declaration followed days of escalating public pressure and mass protests. Thousands of women and men joined a national Women for Change shutdown, including a large gathering at Constitution Hill in Johannesburg, where protesters staged a minute of silence at noon for the fifteen women reported killed each day in South Africa. Organisers described the turnout as massive and called for immediate, concrete action from government and institutions. Reporting notes that while the national disaster declaration is an important symbolic step, critics and activists say it comes with caveats and now needs clear, funded implementation plans — not just rhetoric.

Conservation received a rare piece of good news this week. BirdLife South Africa and volunteers announced the discovery of a new population of Botha’s Lark, a bird that has been the subject of grave concern after no confirmed sightings for eighteen months. The species remains critically endangered, with estimates suggesting fewer than three hundred and forty birds survive in the wild. The new sightings are being treated as a vital lifeline. Conservationists are moving urgently to protect the newly discovered birds and the sensitive grassland habitat they need to survive. The discovery has injected fresh optimism into efforts to prevent what would otherwise have been South Africa’s first recorded bird extinction.

And a brief note on local logistics as the summit proceeds: Gauteng motorists have been warned to expect road closures and detours across Johannesburg this weekend to secure routes to Nasrec and accommodate summit traffic. Authorities have been working to present the city at its best in the event, repairing and painting key routes while advising drivers to plan alternative journeys or expect delays.

That is the Mzansi Lowdown for today.

That is all for today,
