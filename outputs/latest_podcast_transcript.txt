First up: new evidence at the Madlanga Commission is deepening the controversy around suspended deputy national police commissioner Shadrack Sibiya. Crime Intelligence head Dumisani Khumalo has told the commission that video and photographs point to links between Sibiya and organised crime figures. Khumalo says Sibiya allegedly used a sergeant to collect bribe money from cartel bosses and that a convicted carjacker supplied the bakkie Sibiya used. The same man reportedly acted as a protective presence when Sibiya testified before Parliament. These revelations form part of broader evidence, Khumalo says, suggesting cartel infiltration inside the South African Police Service and raising questions about leadership and integrity in the force. Sibiya has denied wrongdoing and is seeking an opportunity to cross examine witnesses at related inquiries. The commission hearings are continuing and investigators are pressing what they describe as troubling links between senior police and criminal networks.

In another high profile policing matter, investigators are following up after an attack on businessman Brown Mogotsi. Mogotsi then had his vehicle sprayed with bullets. Eyewitness accounts are under scrutiny after a witness told reporters that a man got out of a car and started firing. That account sits alongside other reporting and appears to contradict immediate suggestions that this was a targeted hit, so police are treating the scene carefully while they verify details. Police say Mogotsi has not yet presented himself to make a formal statement and are waiting for him to come forward so they can take his version of events as part of their enquiries. The incident is being investigated as part of ongoing probes that have previously drawn public attention to Mogotsi because of his high profile and controversial connections.

In governance and elections news, President Cyril Ramaphosa has reappointed Mosotho Moepya and Mangila Pillay to the Independent Electoral Commission for another term. The appointments come as the IEC prepares for the critical local government elections next year. The Economic Freedom Fighters have said they are deeply disturbed by the reappointments. The change at the IEC follows wider debate about electoral readiness, technology choices, and the first Wednesday of November being targeted as the likely date for the two thousand twenty six poll. With more than four hundred parties expected to contest, the composition and perceived independence of the commission will remain a central issue for parties and voters.

In economic headlines: South Africans will see softer fuel prices this month. Official adjustments announced this week confirm cuts to petrol from midnight, driven by a stronger rand and lower oil prices. Reports say petrol will drop by fifty one cents a litre in the November cycle, a relief for motorists after months of pressure on household budgets. Currency moves and changes in global oil prices will continue to influence pump prices going forward.

On the transformation and business front, government is revising plans for a big new empowerment fund. The Department of Trade, Industry and Competition has produced a refreshed concept document for a one hundred billion rand Transformation Fund. The updated version aims to be more attractive to companies and addresses governance, access to capability and how contributions could translate into enterprise and supplier development scorecard points. The adjustments are intended to broaden participation by allowing firms to earn compliance credit through meaningful contributions to the fund, while trying to fix problems that dogged earlier iterations of the proposal.
