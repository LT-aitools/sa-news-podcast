Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A I host, Leah. Today is Saturday, the thirteenth of December, two thousand and twenty-five. Let us get straight into the headlines.

First up: a boost on jobs. The Youth Employment Service, or YES programme, has reached a major milestone, creating two hundred thousand quality work opportunities for young South Africans. The initiative reports that about seventy four percent of participants come from households reliant on social grants, and the programme says it has helped forty four thousand families move out of poverty. The work placements are not limited to low skill tasks. YES stresses that many of these opportunities provide future oriented skills in technology and green innovation, and one in five alumni go on to start their own businesses. This is an important numbers story for a country grappling with stubborn youth unemployment, and the milestone will be watched closely by employers, policymakers and young people seeking a foothold into the labour market.

In legal and education news: the Pretoria High Court has dismissed a bid described in court papers as fanciful to block the publication of matric results. The ruling confirms that matric results may be published using candidates examination numbers, a practice in place since two thousand and twenty two. The decision follows an application by the information regulator that had previously sought to prevent such public release. The court confirmation clears the way for results to remain accessible on public platforms, balancing transparency and privacy in the system for senior certificate candidates across the country.

A major safety and rescue story from KwaZulu Natal: a four storey temple in Redcliffe, north of Durban, collapsed on Friday afternoon. Rescue teams continue to work at the scene after the building came down in Verulam. At least one person has died and others remain trapped or injured, according to multiple reports. Ethekwini municipality has said preliminary investigations found there were no approved building plans for the structure. Community members and emergency services have been involved in search and rescue operations, and the identity of some believed to be trapped was reported in local updates. This remains an unfolding tragedy in a township community, and authorities will be expected to provide further details as the rescue operation continues and as investigations into planning approvals proceed.

In national infrastructure news: Johannesburg residents are preparing for water disruptions over the festive season. Rand Water and Johannesburg Water have briefed the media about a major maintenance programme that will require shutdowns at two big treatment stations, Zuikerbosch and Eikenhof. Authorities say residents should prepare for intermittent supplies and outline contingency measures, including a new water tanker fleet to support communities during the disruptions. The shutdown is part of planned maintenance, but it comes at a sensitive time of year when demand is high, so municipal readiness and clear communication will be critical to limit hardship for households and businesses. Residents are being urged to store safe amounts of water for essential uses and to follow guidance from local water authorities to reduce pressure on the system.

On the diplomatic front: South Africa has formally asked its fellow Group of Twenty members to object to the countrys exclusion by the United States from a forthcoming summit. The request was lodged in advance of a sherpas meeting in Washington and seeks support from partners for South Africas inclusion in the global grouping. The move follows public statements of regret by government ministers and has drawn backing from some international partners, with Beijing explicitly supportive of South Africas inclusion. The request marks a rare and direct diplomatic step from Pretoria aimed at securing a place at the table for the country in discussions that affect global economic and political cooperation.

A few shorter items to round up the bulletin. The Border Management Authority interdicted two suspected human trafficking operations at OR Tambo International Airport this week, intercepting groups of Ethiopian and Bangladeshi nationals and imposing penalties on one carrier. The National Prosecuting Authority and law enforcement have continued asset forfeiture actions, freezing more than twelve million rand in properties linked to illegal mining syndicates. And locally, civil society and some political parties continue to press for accountability in municipal corruption cases, with recent arrests and court appearances underscoring the ongoing fight against graft. These matters highlight enforcement activity on migration, organised crime and local governance, all of which remain priorities for national and provincial agencies.
