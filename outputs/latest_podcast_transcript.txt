Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A I host, Leah. Today is the twenty eighth of November, two thousand and twenty five.

First up: diplomatic tensions with the United States. Media reports this week say former United States president Donald Trump has said South Africa will not be invited to next years G Twenty summit in Miami. These reports follow a dispute over this years G Twenty presidency handover. South African officials have described the move as punitive. President Cyril Ramaphosa has publicly defended South Africas sovereignty and its right to participate in global platforms, and he has called for unity in response to what local coverage framed as an insult to the country. South African officials are discussing next steps and alternative ways to engage with other G Twenty members and the broader international community, noting that South Africas membership has the backing of other member states according to those reports. This is an evolving diplomatic story that could have implications for how South Africa positions itself on international economic and security matters. We note that some details are based on emerging reports and remain under verification.

Next: urgent concern among health non governmental organisations. Following public comments attributed to the former United States president about stopping United States payments and subsidies to South Africa, local health NGOs report growing fear and confusion. Organisations that rely on external funding, including long running programmes supported by United States partners, are now unsure about the future of that support. Reports say NGOs are seeking clarity from both United States and South African authorities about what funding may be affected and how services will be sustained if aid is reduced or withdrawn. Public health experts and civil society warn that sudden cuts could worsen already strained services in clinics and community programmes, particularly those tackling complex health challenges. This story ties directly into domestic healthcare pressures and underlines how international policy shifts can have immediate consequences for delivery on the ground. Again, these claims stem from ongoing statements and discussions and are being monitored.

Now to parliamentary testimony and allegations of political corruption. Vusimuzi Cat Matlala, a businessman and an accused organised crime figure, gave dramatic testimony before Parliaments ad hoc committee this week. He told Members of Parliament that former national police minister Bheki Cele demanded one million rand from him, and that Cele frequently asked to stay at Matlalas penthouse. Matlala has also alleged that his security company provided backup security to the Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Municipality during the previous administration of Mayor Mzwandile Masina, and that he donated vehicles to the Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Police Department. Matlala has previously claimed to have made a payment of five hundred thousand rand to stop perceived harassment by an investigative unit, and he expanded on those allegations during hearings. Parliament and opposition Members of Parliament reacted strongly; some members dismissed Matlala as an unreliable and dishonest witness, while others called for investigations. Separately, an Eswatini home affairs official has been arrested over allegations she issued Matlala with fraudulent documentation. These hearings raise serious questions about procurement, political interference in policing, and the links between private security companies and municipal contracts. The allegations are subject to further investigation and legal processes.

In legal and governance news: the shortlist for the National Director of Public Prosecutions, the NDPP, has been announced with six candidates named to replace outgoing NDPP Shamila Batohi, who retires in January. Notably among the shortlisted is Menzi Simelane, the former prosecutions boss whose appointment by ex president Jacob Zuma was invalidated by the Constitutional Court in two thousand and twelve after critical findings in the Ginwala inquiry. Simelanes inclusion has reignited debate about fitness and integrity criteria for the countrys top prosecutorial post. The president will have less than two months to decide on a successor, and commentators say this appointment will be closely watched given the high stakes for the national anti corrosion agenda and public confidence in prosecutions.

Turning to infrastructure and water management: the Department of Water and Sanitation opened sluice gates at the Vaal Dam as water levels rose rapidly. Reporting indicates that up to ten sluice gates are now open to manage inflows and reduce pressure on the dam system. Officials described the situation as under control and said further gates have been opened as a precaution. Engineers and municipal authorities are monitoring downstream effects and coordinating water releases to safeguard communities and critical infrastructure. The rapid rise in levels follows heavy rainfall in catchment areas and underscores the continuing challenges of managing large dam systems in extreme weather conditions.

A quick wrap on governance oversight. The Office of the National Director of Public Prosecutions and parliamentary committees continue to pursue inquiries into prosecutorial decisions, withdrawals of charges, and the conduct of senior legal officials. Recent testimony and submissions have focused on whether proper processes were followed in high profile cases, and watchdog groups are demanding transparency. These debates feed directly into public trust in the criminal justice system and will influence pending appointments and legal reviews in the coming weeks.

That is all for today,
