Howzit South Africa and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your AI host Leah. Today is the fourth of January two thousand and twenty six.

First up political and diplomatic fallout over a major international incident that Pretoria says directly concerns South Africa. Many news outlets have widely reported that the United States carried out strikes and that Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro was captured. In response the Department of International Relations and Cooperation described the action as a manifest violation of the United Nations Charter. South Africa has called for the United Nations Security Council to convene urgently to address the matter. The call is framed as an appeal to the international community to respond to what Pretoria views as an unlawful use of force. That reaction underlines Pretoria concern about unilateral military interventions and signals that South Africa will be seeking multilateral scrutiny through the United Nations system.

Next local crime and politics. News outlets report that Gayton McKenzie has said he possesses new information regarding the disappearance of Joshlin Smith. This follows attention on the delayed launch of a foundation linked to the case after a five hundred day wait. Reporting indicates ongoing public and political interest in how private initiatives and political figures intersect with high profile criminal matters. The development adds another chapter to a case that has attracted sustained media attention and public scrutiny. Journalists and commentators continue to stress the need for careful handling of evidence and respect for the investigative process.

Turning to municipal and local government issues the year ahead is shaping up as a critical one for local elections and media coverage highlights metropolitan councils as key battlegrounds. Political parties are jockeying for control of eight metropolitan areas where coalition politics and early mayoral manoeuvres will be decisive. Analysts describe a fragile political order at municipal level with the ruling party the African National Congress weakened while opposition parties contend with internal divisions. Observers suggest that control of metropolitan areas will be central to governing power and to service delivery and that the outcomes of these contests will have implications for national politics in the months ahead.

On the law and accountability front several items in the news point to high profile criminal cases and inquiries moving forward this year. The Sunday Times reports that a number of major corruption and murder cases are set to progress in two thousand and twenty six with trials or judgments expected to move closer. Relatedly the Madlanga inquiry has drawn attention to serious allegations and calls for further probes including into the Independent Police Investigative Directorate. Commentators are urging that the inquiry extend scrutiny where necessary and that state institutions be shown to act on credible evidence of wrongdoing. These stories collectively underscore a theme: accountability institutions and the courts will be in focus as cases that captured public attention last year advance.

Now to public safety on our roads. Multiple outlets are reporting a surge in drunk driving and related arrests as authorities tighten festive season clampdowns. Traffic enforcement agencies have warned of a crisis with thousands detained over the period and the Road Traffic Management Corporation reporting increases in drunk driving and bribery. Law enforcement operations over the New Year included extensive arrests in central Johannesburg and heightened monitoring on major routes into Gauteng as authorities sought to reduce deaths and serious injuries on the roads. The message from officials is clear policing will remain robust and road safety campaigns will be stepped up as holiday travel continues to decline.

A separate local governance story has raised questions about conduct in office. News24 reports that an African National Congress mayor allegedly assaulted emergency workers and police at the scene after a family member died in a car crash. The allegation comes amid broader scrutiny of official behaviour and the standards expected of public representatives. The story is under investigation and will be followed closely as authorities determine what happened and whether further action is required. Media outlets say they will update the public as more verified information becomes available.

Finally in culture and civil society the Cape Town Minstrel Carnival Association is reported to be seeking public funds while it pursues a court battle with the City of Cape Town over venues. The association says it needs resources to support legal efforts aimed at securing spaces for traditional minstrel competition events. The dispute highlights tensions between cultural organisations and municipal authorities over public venues and heritage events and has drawn public debate about the funding and preservation of historic cultural practices.

That is the Mzansi Lowdown for today. That is all for today.
