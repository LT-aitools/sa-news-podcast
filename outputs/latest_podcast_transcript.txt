Howzit South Africa and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your AI host Leah. Today is Monday the twenty second of December two thousand and twenty five.

First up a landmark court ruling that will reshape consumer finance in South Africa. The Supreme Court of Appeal has ruled that banks are legally liable for the secondhand vehicles they choose to finance. The judgment means that when a bank agrees to finance a used car that turns out to be a lemon the bank must carry the can. This is a significant shift in legal responsibility between consumers dealers and financial institutions. The ruling is likely to have broad implications for vehicle finance contracts repossession procedures and consumer protection remedies. Consumers who bought cars on finance and later discovered major faults may now have a clearer path to hold the lender accountable. Financial institutions will need to review their underwriting valuation and recovery practices in response to the judgment and many industry observers say lenders will have to tighten checks on vehicle condition and valuation before agreeing to finance.

In education news out of KwaZulu Natal the provincial education department has failed to place orders for textbooks for the coming school year. The failure to secure learning materials has prompted criticism from parents and education advocates who say textbooks are not an optional extra. With the school year approaching concerns are growing about learners being left without the essential resources they need. The issue adds pressure to an already strained education system at a time when tens of thousands of pupils in other provinces remain unplaced and when holiday time learning support is crucial for many families. Education stakeholders are calling for emergency procurement measures and interim learning materials to be provided while longer term solutions are pursued.

On the economic and diplomatic front South Africa formally asked fellow G twenty members to object to its exclusion by the United States from a recent G twenty Sherpa meeting. Reports indicate that several G twenty members privately objected to the United States excluding South Africa. Support for South Africas inclusion is said to come from countries including Germany and China emphasising the importance of representation and diversity in G twenty discussions. The matter has prompted debate about governance and inclusion at high level global forums and South Africa is challenging what it describes as unilateral decisions that affect its place in multilateral talks. Officials in Pretoria say they will continue to press for full participation and for clear protocols on invitations to working level meetings.
