First up: dramatic scenes in two high profile national inquiries. At the Madlanga commission of inquiry into alleged corruption and political interference in the criminal justice system, controversial North West businessman Brown Mogotsi has come under heavy fire. Evidence leaders and counsel have described his testimony as fanciful and called him a professional liar as cross examination exposed contradictions. Mogotsi has been making sweeping claims, including allegations that some senior officials were connected to foreign intelligence agencies. Commissioners and legal teams have pushed back, saying his version of events lacks independent proof and in some instances is self evidently absurd. His evidence is now in the spotlight as the commission prepares further hearings and more witnesses are lined up. The commission is expected to consider documentary corroboration and to test witness credibility in coming sessions.

Related to that inquiry, Cedrick Nkabinde, chief of staff in the police ministry, has made serious allegations before Parliament s ad hoc committee. Nkabinde told MPs he had met with private investigator Paul OSullivan, members of the Democratic Alliance, and representatives of AfriForum, and that those meetings formed part of a plan to remove former national police commissioner Khomotso Phahlane. In separate testimony Nkabinde explained why he recorded KwaZulu Natal police commissioner Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi, and he defended his actions amid intense questioning. The allegations add to an increasingly tangled political drama around alleged interference in prosecutions and policing. Parliament confirmed that testimony from another central figure, Vusimuzi Cat Matlala, is expected next week. Oversight committees say they will weigh the evidence carefully as they consider possible referrals or further investigations.

In other politics and governance news, the United States has taken a firm line with Pretoria ahead of South Africas hosting of the G twenty leaders summit. South African media report that the White House has written to government officials warning the country not to issue a G twenty declaration in the absence of the United States at the leaders meeting this weekend. The move comes as Pretoria prepares to host international delegations and tries to shape an agenda despite a highly unusual situation in which the United States will not be present. Sources say the correspondence represents an eleventh hour push by Washington to influence how the summit is run and what statements are released. South African officials and analysts will be watching closely as the summit gets under way, mindful of diplomatic sensitivities and the reputational stakes of hosting a major gathering.

Turning to local governance and municipal finances: shocking findings from the Auditor General and parliamentary briefings have raised fresh questions about Johannesburg s water utility. Auditors say an amount of four billion rand that the City of Johannesburg says is available to Joburg Water exists only on paper and not in bank accounts. The arrangement, described in parliamentary and Auditor General reports, involves a sweeping financial plan that effectively moves the cash off the utility s balance sheet while leaving critical water infrastructure at risk. Opposition parties and oversight bodies have been vocal, saying the city does not have the cash in hand to cover the four billion rand and warning that the accounting manoeuvre threatens service delivery. The matter is fuelling wider criticism of the city s financial stewardship as it prepares to host high profile international events and as residents demand clarity on water provision and maintenance.

Another human interest and diplomatic concern: a group of South African men, including a relative of former president Jacob Zuma, are stranded on the frontline in eastern Ukraine and have pleaded for help. The group say they were taken to Russia under the pretext of bodyguard training and were then placed on the frontlines of the conflict in Donbas. Speaking through relatives, one of the men described severe conditions, a lack of communication, and fears about exposure to the harsh Russian winter. They accuse those who organised their travel of abandoning them in life threatening circumstances and say their pleas for assistance have been ignored. South African officials and families are seeking clarity about how the men were recruited and what steps can be taken to bring them home. The issue has prompted diplomatic enquiries and calls for consular support while families seek more information from authorities.

Finally, in party politics: Malusi Gigaba has stepped aside from his African National Congress party roles after formal charges were brought against him in a corruption case linked to allegations around Transnet. Party sources described his decision as voluntary and principled. Gigaba faces court processes and the party said it welcomed his temporary withdrawal while the matter proceeds. The development adds yet another headline to a week in which accountability and governance questions have dominated national debate. Party leaders say they will follow their disciplinary procedures and the courts will determine the legal outcome.
