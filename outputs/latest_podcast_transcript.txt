Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A I host, Leah. Today is nine January two thousand and twenty six.

First up: wildfires in the Eastern Cape. Emergency services and municipal authorities have issued evacuation orders in the Kouga municipality after fast moving veld fires tore through towns, rural properties and orchards. Reports say homes and farms have been destroyed and residents were urged to leave affected areas immediately as fires threatened local infrastructure. Relief efforts are intensifying and several road closures have been reported as firefighters and volunteers battle to contain multiple blazes. Local disaster management teams are coordinating temporary shelter and assistance for displaced families while prioritising search and rescue where needed. We will keep an eye on official updates, but for now authorities are asking residents in threatened areas to prioritise safety and follow evacuation instructions.

In education: with the school year starting in days, almost twenty three thousand pupils across four provinces remain without placements. The provinces affected include Gauteng, the Western Cape, Limpopo and Mpumalanga. Parents are growing anxious and many are going to education offices in person to try to secure spots for their children. The situation comes as Grade R is now compulsory but many schools lack the classrooms, teachers and funding to accommodate all pupils. Education officials and parents face a short window to resolve placements before the academic year begins. Schools and provincial education departments are under pressure to provide temporary solutions while longer term planning continues.

Turning to the national economy: manufacturing activity continued to slide in December according to the Absa Purchasing Managers Index, which fell to forty point five, the weakest reading since April two thousand and twenty. The report highlights steep declines in inventories and employment within the sector, signalling pressure on factories as they head into the new year. Separately, South African maize futures have dropped to four year lows, a development that is likely to ease food inflation for consumers but presents mixed outcomes for farmers who face squeezed margins. The combination of slow factory activity and lower commodity prices points to a fragile start to two thousand and twenty six for parts of the economy. Economists warn that export revenues and rural livelihoods may still be affected even as consumer prices stabilise.

In consumer safety and public health: parents in South Africa are being asked to check baby formula stock after a global contamination recall. A routine quality check in the Netherlands led to a Nestle recall of some NAN infant formula, and those products have been identified on South African shelves. Health authorities and retailers are advising parents to return affected tins. If you use NAN formula, check your packaging and follow recall instructions from stores and the manufacturer. Health departments have reiterated that affected batches should not be used and that parents with concerns should seek medical advice from their local clinic or paediatrician.

On governance and public services: serious concerns remain about military housing and basic service standards. The Waterfall barracks, the main South African Navy facility in Simons Town, has been reported in a state of disrepair. Investigations and reporting describe hazardous and undignified living conditions for sailors, including persistent water and electricity problems, non functioning toilets and exposure to broken and exposed asbestos. Sources say repeated warnings and reports have not produced meaningful fixes. The deterioration raises questions about maintenance, oversight and the welfare of service personnel. Defence officials say assessments are ongoing and that plans are being developed to address the most urgent health and safety issues as funding and logistics allow.

In science and youth achievement: four South African teenagers have won top honours at the World Innovative Science Project Olympiad in Indonesia. The young researchers brought home gold and silver medals for projects designed to tackle global challenges. Observers say the results underscore growing strength in youth led scientific innovation and problem solving here at home. The students were recognised for inventive approaches to environmental and technological problems and have been invited to local events to showcase their projects. It is a bright note for South African education and research amid the other challenges we outlined today.

And finally, on law and order: Johannesburg authorities continue an operation against hijacked properties following a raid in Bryanston that led to the eviction of one hundred and fifty illegal occupants and the arrest of an alleged hijacker. The City is targeting at least seventeen hijacked homes as it seeks to recover properties and address the social harm caused by long term illegal occupation. Officials note that legal delays and complex recovery processes remain obstacles for affected owners. The City has said it will work with social services to find alternatives for evicted occupants and with the courts to speed up restitution where possible.
