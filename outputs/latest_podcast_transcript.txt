First up, growing alarm over the reported murder of a key witness who testified at the Madlanga commission. Over the weekend authorities confirmed that the man known publicly as Witness D was killed outside his home. Reporting in several outlets links his testimony to allegations implicating senior figures in the Ekurhuleni Metro Police Department, and one news organisation named the suspended deputy head Julius Mkhwanazi as someone Witness D had implicated.

President Cyril Ramaphosa has publicly condemned what the presidency described as a heinous killing. The murder has intensified scrutiny of witness protection measures and whistleblower security. The Daily Maverick reported that the killing refocused attention on the risks faced by those who come forward in high profile inquiries, documenting how witnesses have described brutal apartheid style torture and threats. Family members told the Sunday Times they felt heartbreak and fear, saying they are being targeted and that the witness had done what he believed he needed to do. Those remarks underline the stakes for those who testify.

Security officials are reportedly exploring multiple possible motives, and the public reaction is already clear: urgent questions remain for police and state agencies about how they will protect witnesses and hold perpetrators to account. The Madlanga inquiry itself is expected to remain in the spotlight as calls grow for accountability and for stronger safeguards.

In crime news that has gripped communities in Gauteng, a mass shooting at a shebeen in Saulsville Atteridgeville left many people dead and injured in the early hours of Saturday. National and local outlets report that at least eleven people were killed, including one very young child, and many others were wounded. TimesLive published survivors telling harrowing stories, including a pregnant woman who escaped by hiding under a bed.

The attack has left neighbours and families traumatised and raised fresh concerns about community safety, gun crime and policing in hostels and informal settlements. Local reports describe communities gripped by fear and calls for swift investigative action. Authorities say they are investigating, and the wider national conversation is likely to focus on how to prevent such mass violence and how to support victims and traumatised communities in the immediate aftermath.

Turning to politics, the African National Congress remains a major story this weekend with developments in Johannesburg and at national level. In the city, Loyiso Masuku won top positions in the local ANC conference, a result described by several outlets as a victory for anti GNU, meaning anti government of national unity, forces in Gauteng. Some reports cast his win as a tactical blow in an ongoing internal struggle. Masuku has downplayed immediate talk of becoming Johannesburg mayor, saying he wants his term to focus on people centred leadership and service delivery.

At national level, the Sunday Times reported that President Ramaphosa and ally Gwede Mantashe are backing Thoko Didiza as a surprise contender for the ANC top job ahead of the party leadership contests. The ANC discussion about forming a government of national unity with the Democratic Alliance remains likely to take centre stage at the party national general council which starts this week. That meeting will test whether proposals and rival camps can shift the party course as it prepares for a difficult run of local government elections next year.

Expect sharp debates at the national general council about alliance strategy, service delivery failures and the direction of the party. For now, the message from several reports is that the ANC is balancing internal factional battles with efforts to present a united face ahead of a crucial electoral cycle.

And in economic news, there are some upbeat signs for South Africas tourism sector and for market sentiment. The Sunday Times reported a rebound in arrivals, with a sharp climb led by other African markets as global travel keeps recovering. The Treasury recent eurobond issue was reported as being more than three times oversubscribed, a development seen as boosting investor sentiment.

On the currency front, a number of business outlets say the rand has recently strengthened, at times breaking through the seventeen rand to the dollar mark, supported by a narrower current account deficit and confidence from international bond issuance. Analysts advise cautious optimism. Consumer and investor confidence remains fragile, but these moves have given policymakers a bit more room to try to sustain growth as the country heads towards next year local elections and the big tests for the national economy.
