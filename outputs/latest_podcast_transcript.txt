First up: testimony at the Madlanga Commission is dominating headlines this weekend. Vusimusi "Cat" Matlala, referred to in reporting as Witness C, continued testimony that has put fresh focus on allegations involving senior police figures and the suspended Police Minister, Senzo Mchunu. Reporting from IOL, Daily Maverick and the Sunday papers summarises a string of claims and counter claims heard in public hearings. Among the most striking accounts are Matlala's claims that link funding for African National Congress celebrations to named officials. The evidence heard has forced politicians and police leaders to answer uncomfortable questions and has prompted denials and rebuttals in turn.

The suspended deputy national commissioner, Shadrack Sibiya, has told the commission that testimony presented so far had created a misleading impression of his role and his relationships with people under investigation, according to TimesLive and the Sunday Times. The hearings have included footage and contested witness statements, and public attention is focused on how political money and policing intersect. The commission continues its proceedings and will likely produce further referrals or recommendations as more testimony is heard.

In national politics: President Cyril Ramaphosa convened a private retreat with leaders of the governing national unity, or GNU, to take stock of the coalition. The meeting, reported by the Sunday Times and TimesLive, is described as a state of play powwow and began today, running into tomorrow. Sources say the retreat is intended to manage tensions and map the future of the GNU amid a turbulent political climate. Details of the discussions are being kept close to the chest, but the presidency frames this as a high priority effort to shore up the coalition and to plan next steps for governance. Expect statements and possible follow ups after the retreat concludes as party leaders seek to resolve internal disputes and present a more coherent front ahead of a difficult political period.

Turning to justice and diplomacy: the Malawi High Court has overturned an earlier order to extradite Shepherd Bushiri and his wife Mary to South Africa, citing safety concerns, according to IOL and News24. The ruling means that the self proclaimed prophet and his wife will not be sent back to South Africa under the current order. The Bushiris face charges in South Africa that include allegations of fraud and money laundering related to their ministry and business activities, and those charges remain on the South African docket.

Malawian judges cited concerns about the Bushiris personal safety and the potential for prejudice in extradition, which contributed to the decision to set aside the previous order. South Africas Justice and Constitutional Development Minister has said officials are studying the judgment and that the government is preparing its next move in response, as reported by TimesLive and EWN. South African authorities have indicated they will review the Malawian judgment and consider options available under international law and bilateral mechanisms. This remains an active matter between the two governments that will be watched closely for appeals or new legal steps.

A round of civic concerns features protests over service delivery in Johannesburg. Protesters marched to the Johannesburg council chamber to highlight persistent water shortages, warning that residents are running out of water and power, according to TimesLive and the Sunday Times. The march included participation by Helen Zille, which adds a political dimension to the demonstrations. Reporting also highlights claims that hundreds of councillors are voting on budgets they cannot read, a story in the Sunday Times that flags governance and capacity problems at municipal level. These reports point to pressure on local authorities and growing public frustration ahead of the two thousand and twenty six local government elections.

Finally, on the economy and infrastructure: Francois Nortje, a developer behind the Port of Gauteng concept, has suggested restructuring highway tolls when the N three concession expires in two thousand and twenty nine. His proposal would allocate a share of toll revenue to rail corridors to improve freight efficiency, according to the Sunday Times and TimesLive. The recommendation feeds into broader debates about freight logistics and shifting more cargo to rail, but it would require policy decisions and coordination between transport authorities and the private sector. Expect further discussion among industry stakeholders and government as the concession end date approaches.

That is the main news for today. That is all for today.
