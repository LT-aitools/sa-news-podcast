Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your AI host, Leah. Today is the fourth of December, two thousand and twenty-five.

First up: a troubling recruitment scandal that has left families desperate. News24 reports that the MK Party was invoiced for at least one of the flights that took South African men to Russia, where they were allegedly duped into joining combat operations rather than receiving the promised bodyguard training. The invoice for one man ticket was for twenty thousand two hundred forty-five rand. Investigations say seventeen men remain stuck in that conflict, and published WhatsApp messages suggest plans for further groups and requests for repayments. The story has widened to include allegations that public figures were involved in arranging travel, and families remain urgently concerned for the safety of their loved ones. News organisations are continuing to track the legal and political fallout as questions mount over who organised the trips and who will be held accountable. At this stage independent verification is limited and reporters continue to seek confirmation from all parties involved.

In national accountability news: testimony continued at the Madlanga Commission of Inquiry this week as suspended Ekurhuleni metro police deputy chief Julius Mkhwanazi took the witness stand. Multiple reports describe a tense and uncomfortable appearance, with Mkhwanazi denying key allegations. He rejected claims that he fitted blue lights to vehicles linked to accused businessman Vusimuzi Cat Matlala and said that offers of free security to the city were made amid concerns for safety. Observers described his demeanour in the witness box as jittery, and the commission is probing a range of serious allegations that include possible interference in investigations and other conduct unbecoming of a senior official. The inquiry proceedings are likely to have broader implications for municipal oversight and for how irregular relationships between officials and private security providers are handled. The commission continues to hear testimony and expects to publish findings in due course.

In governance and public finances: the Auditor General scrutiny of student funding and NSFAS operations has stirred fresh concern. The Sunday Times reports the Auditor General found that NSFAS books are disorganised and that financials may have been misrepresented, with the fund recording a loss of eighty-four million rand in its latest accounts. At the same time law enforcement activity has followed allegations of fraud in student funding. A twenty-four year old former student representative council member from Rustenburg TVET College was arrested by the Hawks on allegations relating to NSFAS students. These developments underline persistent challenges in the administration of student support and the risk that mismanagement and alleged fraud will undermine access to higher education for vulnerable students. Officials say audit work and criminal investigations are continuing, and there will be pressure for stronger controls and greater transparency at NSFAS.

In business leadership news: PwC South Africa has announced its next chief executive. The professional services firm named Anastacia Tshesane, who currently chairs its Africa governance structure, as the South Africa chief executive designate. The appointment marks a significant internal leadership shift at one of the country largest advisory firms and comes as the private sector faces renewed pressure to support economic growth, infrastructure development and the management of public-private engagements. Industry watchers say the new appointment will be watched for how the firm positions itself on corporate governance and local economic participation.

On social services and inclusion: the Gauteng health department says it is accelerating support for people living with disabilities. TimesLive reports that more than forty-two thousand assistive devices have been issued in the first two quarters of the two thousand twenty-five to two thousand twenty-six financial year. Officials frame the push as part of an effort to make the province more inclusive and to ensure that assistive technology is available where it is needed. The scale of distribution suggests an increased focus on rehabilitation and independence, though delivery and follow-up will be key to measuring impact on the ground. Officials say they will publish further details on types of devices distributed and plans to improve access in rural and peri-urban areas.

And a look at local disaster recovery: in KwaZulu-Natal search and recovery teams have now located all three victims who were swept away during the recent New Hanover floods. The bodies were recovered as flood recovery operations near completion, bringing closure to that tragic incident and highlighting ongoing concerns around extreme weather and the need for improved local disaster preparedness. Authorities continue to assess damage to infrastructure and warn communities in vulnerable areas to heed flood warnings during the rainy season.

That is the main news for today. We have focused on the stories with the greatest potential impact on South Africans, and have not included international items that do not directly involve the country.

That is all for today.
