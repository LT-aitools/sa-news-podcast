Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A I host, Leah. Today is Thursday, the sixth of November, two thousand and twenty-five.

First up: politics and the Western Cape. The province is seeing a fresh wave of defections that could reshape next year elections. Former ANC Western Cape provincial secretary Neville Delport is among senior figures who have resigned from the African National Congress and joined the Democratic Alliance. Reports say the moves follow a reconfiguration of the ANC provincial executive, a reshuffle that has prompted senior leaders to leave. Analysts quoted in coverage say these departures reflect growing leadership struggles and factionalism in the provincial ANC. The Democratic Alliance is framing the defections as a net gain as it seeks to strengthen its position ahead of the two thousand and twenty-six polls.

Next: policing and parliamentary scrutiny. Acting Police Minister Firoz Cachalia has returned to Parliament to testify before an ad hoc committee probing allegations of corruption and mismanagement in the criminal justice system. In testimony covered today, Cachalia called the disbandment of the Scorpions a mistake. The Scorpions were an elite national anti corruption unit formally known as the Directorate of Special Operations that was dissolved in two thousand and nine. Cachalia also expressed concern about KwaZulu Natal police commissioner Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi, saying the former July press briefing in which Mkhwanazi appeared in military or Special Task Force style regalia "worried" him. He told MPs he had difficulties understanding the decision by suspended minister Senzo Mchunu to disband the Political Killings Task Team, and he defended delegating duties to his deputies to ensure the police ministry continues to function.

In crime and high profile investigations: police have executed search and seizure warrants linked to businessman Brown Mogotsi. Authorities say devices were seized as part of ongoing probes. Eyewitnesses allege Mogotsi shot his own car during an incident that authorities are investigating. Police are arranging for Mogotsi to meet with investigators and his lawyers to obtain a formal statement, and investigators are probing the alleged attempted murder after securing witness statements. Media commentary has urged that Mogotsi cooperate with inquiries and appear before the Madlanga commission into corruption in the criminal justice system.

Turning to public health: Tshwane is facing a spike in typhoid cases. Health reports published today note new typhoid infections in the Tshwane metro, and officials and health writers are urging urgent action. The Water and Sanitation Ministry has said it is worried about rising typhoid cases in the Hammanskraal area. The outbreak has prompted warnings that failing municipal services may be contributing, and local media and public health experts call on the coalition government in Tshwane to act swiftly to contain the spread. Health authorities advise residents to be alert to symptoms and to follow official guidance.

In other health and safety news: the National Institute for Communicable Diseases has issued warnings about rabies risks in South Africa ahead of the December holiday travel period. Officials are alerting the public and travellers to recent rabies cases among dogs, Cape fur seals and other mammals. Nine Cape fur seals in Mossel Bay have tested positive, and authorities are urging people to be cautious around wild and stray animals, particularly in coastal areas where seal encounters occur. Public advisories suggest holidaymakers consider rabies risk when choosing destinations and avoid contact with potentially infected animals.

On technology and government services: the Presidency and the Department of Transport have jointly piloted a working digital driving licence. A newly created four person team in the Presidency developed a working digital driving licence for South Africa in just three months, and authorities demonstrated a live demo of the digital licence platform. Reporting also notes progress on a one stop government services portal to streamline access to public services. Officials present these steps as part of a push to modernise administration and make document and service access easier for citizens, though broader rollout and security details remain under discussion.

A quick business and legal update: after an almost two decade legal battle, inventor Nkosana Makate and Vodacom have reached an out of court settlement over the Please Call Me invention. The Please Call Me service was a mobile messaging concept that allowed users to send a free message asking someone to call them back, and it led to a long running dispute over compensation and intellectual property. Makate said he is relieved the almost two decade dispute is over following the settlement. Media coverage frames the deal as bringing closure to a case that stretched nearly twenty years.

Finally, education and institutional resilience: civil society groups have rallied to protect the University of Fort Hare after recent arson and destruction at the historic campus. The University of Fort Hare is one of South Africas historically significant higher education institutions, known for educating prominent African leaders and playing a key role in anti apartheid history. The university is working on a recovery plan to enable students to return to campus safely, and administrators are focused on restoring normal academic activity. Separately, the University of Cape Towns Child Gauge two thousand and twenty five report highlighted the intersection of violence against women and children, warning that cycles of violence and neglect during pregnancy are deepening maternal and child health crises.

That is the main news for this Thursday, the sixth of November, two thousand and twenty five.

That is all for today,
