First up: a tragic mass shooting in Reiger Park in Boksburg. A twenty nine year old father, Leocant Joseph, died after shielding his one year old son during a drive by attack that left six people dead and three others wounded.

The station commander has warned the police station operates with only two vehicles to serve a high crime area, highlighting severe resource shortages.

In policing and accountability news: the Auditor General has revealed irregular expenditure at the South African Police Service totalling six hundred and fifty million rand for the two thousand twenty four slash twenty five financial year, while two point five billion rand previously flagged for concern remains unresolved. The audit found persistent non compliance with supply chain management rules and noted questions about how tenders were awarded. The report points to failures in oversight as unsuitable bidders continued to secure contracts.

Related oversight work is unfolding at the Madlanga Commission of Inquiry, which continues to probe allegations of criminality and political interference in the criminal justice system. This week the commission heard testimony that Hawks officials gave contradictory accounts about their response to the arrest of businessman Katiso Molefe. Witnesses said officers were pressured in the lead up to the Molefe operation; one Hawks member said he was urged to drive recklessly to meet a schedule, while another described unnecessary delays. Crime intelligence boss Lieutenant General Dumisani Khumalo is set to return to testify as the commission pursues a fuller account of whether interference occurred and who may have been responsible. The hearings have repeatedly highlighted threats and heavy pressure faced by investigators in high profile cases.

In transport: questions are mounting over the future operator of the Gautrain as the Bombela Concession Company s contract approaches its end. The Gautrain Management Agency has not yet selected a replacement operator, despite plans to do so more than a year ago. Bombela, the consortium that built and has run the service, remains part of a bid for the next operating contract, but the delayed procurement process has left little time. Government and private bidders now face pressure to conclude the selection so the network s continuity is not jeopardised when the current concession lapses.

And finally, a quick courts update out of Johannesburg: a high court judge has given the City of Johannesburg a two week deadline to verify, register and allocate trading stands to informal traders in the inner city.
