Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your AI host Leah. Today is the second of December two thousand twenty five.

A brief note before we begin: a routine fact check on this episode returned no definitive verification for some details in the original source material. Where reporting remains unclear I have indicated that those details are based on current media reports and official statements and may be subject to change as investigations and inquiries continue.

First up: the Madlanga commission of inquiry continues to dominate courtroom headlines in Pretoria. Former Ekurhuleni city manager Imogen Mashazi gave testimony this week about the controversial so called blue lights saga. Mashazi denied that she had tried to shield Ekurhuleni metro police Brigadier Julius Mkhwanazi from scrutiny, but she admitted she had failed to act when she received documents that set out allegations against him. The evidence presented to the commission included documents from the Independent Police Investigative Directorate that, Mashazi said, made the accusations against Mkhwanazi look serious and deserving of investigation.

The commission has also been told of wider failures in the metro. Mashazi is accused of not acting on allegations of sexual assault and corruption within Ekurhuleni metro police, and the hearings at times became heated, with questions raised about the handling of WhatsApp records and phone calls. The Madlanga inquiry is expected to deliver an interim report to the President by mid December and it remains a focal point for accountability in municipal policing and procurement. Listeners should note that reporting on internal commission evidence continues to evolve and some aspects remain subject to legal challenge.

Next: a national security and criminal investigation into the alleged recruitment of South Africans for the Russian military has developed this week. Five suspects are now facing charges in court in connection with an alleged plot to recruit South Africans as mercenaries. Among those remanded is a prominent SAfm presenter who, together with four others, has been linked in reporting to an alleged recruitment scheme. The Hawks have indicated their investigation may not be complete; investigators have said more arrests remain possible and they are exploring links across provinces.

News outlets are also parsing possible connections between separate cases, including high profile figures who have been prominent in recent media coverage. These developments put law enforcement under scrutiny as prosecutors and detectives try to untangle alleged recruitment networks and any cross provincial ties. As with the previous item, some details are based on media reports and court filings and may change as formal charges are clarified.

In politics: internal African National Congress tensions continue alongside vocal backing for President Cyril Ramaphosa. Across the party, the ANC leagues have publicly rallied behind the President amid persistent murmurs that some groups want him removed ahead of the party national general council. The leagues show of support comes as rumours of plots to recall the President have circulated, prompting party officials to say removal is not on the national general council agenda.

At the same time, the Sunday press and other coverage suggest party structures will investigate claims of lobbying by former RET members seeking his resignation. The situation remains fluid. For now, key ANC constituencies are issuing messages of unity and support for the President even as internal debates continue, and party leaders say they will address complaints and allegations through established internal processes.

Health and science brings a major World AIDS Day story. Deputy President Paul Mashatile this week led commemorations and announced plans for a breakthrough HIV prevention injection, with rollout scheduled for two thousand twenty six. The injections are being hailed as a significant prevention tool and the government has set out ambitions for wider access. Separately, health commentators and government sources are discussing the possibility of local manufacture. Officials say the country hopes to start making its own six monthly HIV prevention jabs by two thousand twenty seven, using local pharmaceutical companies to produce generics and to fill projected supply gaps as the nation pursues the goal of ending AIDS.

Reporting highlights a hitch: logistical and regulatory issues must be resolved before local production can begin. Officials have also warned about another painful problem, that more than one million people have fallen out of HIV treatment, a challenge the health system must confront even as prevention tools expand. Listeners should be aware that timelines depend on regulatory approvals and international procurement arrangements.

Weather and public safety: severe storms and unexpected hail this week have hit parts of Gauteng and neighbouring provinces. The South African Weather Service issued warnings about thunderstorms likely to bring heavy rain, damaging winds, excessive lightning and localised flooding, particularly for Gauteng, Limpopo and Mpumalanga. Residents in affected areas reported hail and overnight damage, with images and eyewitness accounts describing wide disruption. Authorities are urging people to stay indoors where possible and to take precautions as extreme weather is expected to intensify through December. If you live in affected areas, follow updates from your local authorities and the weather service.

A brief political note: Lucky Montana, the former PRASA boss and MK Party member of Parliament, announced his resignation from Parliament. His departure comes amid coverage of instability within smaller parties and continued scrutiny of public officials who have previously held executive positions. Media coverage suggests party leaders will confirm any replacement procedures in due course.

That is the main South African news for today. Stay safe out there, check on your neighbours if severe weather affects your area, and remember that some of the reports I have summarised are still under verification and may be updated as new information becomes available. We will be back with more tomorrow.

That is all for today,
