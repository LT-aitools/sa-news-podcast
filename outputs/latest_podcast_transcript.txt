Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host Leah. Today is the second of January two thousand and twenty six South African time.

First up a high profile oversight finding from the Office of the Public Protector. The Public Protector has delivered its quarterly report into allegations over catering on the presidential aircraft Inkwazi. The office cleared the Presidency and the Department of Defence of financial misconduct in relation to the contested catering arrangements. At the same time the Public Protector raised concerns about separate governance issues, including the alleged misuse of petrol cards and instances of municipal maladministration. The report notes these matters separately and says further oversight and scrutiny by relevant bodies and parliamentarians will be needed. The decision effectively ends months of public scrutiny over the Inkwazi catering drama while signaling that other governance problems flagged in the same report will remain on the oversight agenda.

In KwaZulu Natal police are investigating a brutal New Years attack in Port Shepstone. Gunmen stormed a family home during what authorities described as an alleged robbery and killed four members of the same family. National and local outlets report that police say they are hunting for four suspects in connection with the murders. Investigators continue to interview witnesses and follow leads. The killings underline continuing concerns about violent crime in parts of the province and law enforcement has appealed for any witnesses with information to come forward as they pursue the suspects and work to bring them to justice.

On our shores holiday season water tragedies continue to claim lives. At Strand Beach in the Western Cape rescue services confirm a fatal drowning. Reports say the victim was a man from Elsies River and that police have opened an inquest as authorities investigate the circumstances of the death. Along the KwaZulu Natal coast an incident off Pennington main beach left at least one person dead with one person rescued and three others reported missing in early updates. Emergency services and community volunteers have been active across the coastline during the festive surge as lifeguards and rescue teams responded to multiple incidents. These events are a stark reminder to beachgoers to heed safety warnings to swim between the flags and to remain cautious in strong surf and changing conditions.

In national leadership news President Cyril Ramaphosa sent a New Year message to the nation as we entered two thousand and twenty six. The President reflected on the year just past noting progress in some areas while acknowledging persistent challenges such as unemployment service delivery pressures and crime. He called on South Africans to hold on to hope and to work for unity across communities. In a pointed appeal during the message he urged men to desist from abusing women and children highlighting the government focus on combating gender based violence as part of broader social priorities for the year ahead. The message asked for collective action from civil society business and community leaders alongside government.

Turning to the economy the rand is off to a buoyant start in two thousand and twenty six with coverage noting a strong open to the year. Analysts point to a mix of global and local factors supporting the currency including market sentiment and relative stability in domestic data. That strength for the rand comes as motorists may see relief at the pumps soon. Fuel analysts and market reports indicate that petrol and diesel price cuts are likely for the January seven price update driven by a firmer rand and softer international oil prices. The prospect of lower fuel costs will be watched closely because it has immediate effects on household budgets transport costs and broader inflationary pressures that affect the cost of living for many South Africans.

A few shorter items to note. South African pop star Makhadzi remains in hospital but is reported to be stable following a car accident. Updates say she is recovering and has thanked fans for their support and well wishes. On health policy KwaZulu Natal authorities have been reminding the public that new HIV prevention tools such as the long acting injection Lenacapavir are not a licence for risky behaviour. Officials encourage continued responsible health practices alongside rollout plans and emphasise the importance of accessing services through recognised public health channels.
