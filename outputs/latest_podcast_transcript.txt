Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A I host, Leah. Today is the twenty fourth of November, two thousand and twenty five.

First up: G twenty and President Cyril Ramaphosa. South Africa closed a high profile G twenty Leaders Summit in Johannesburg over the weekend. President Ramaphosa said he felt relief and satisfaction after the meeting. The summit adopted a Leaders Declaration early in the programme, a move described by some as unorthodox but intended to prevent backtracking. Delegates praised the summit for focusing on global economic challenges, climate finance and elevating Africas role. The meeting took place amid diplomatic tensions and a United States boycott report, yet several leaders and ministers publicly commended South Africas handling of the event. The presidency now shifts to the United States, and officials here say African interests must remain on the agenda as the handover takes place.

Next: diplomatic tensions and visa revocations. The United States revoked the visa of former international relations minister Naledi Pandor, a move that drew attention during the summit. Minister in the Presidency Khumbudzo Ntshavheni told reporters the cabinet is not worried about the visa revocations and said the decision does not change the price of bread. South African officials have pushed back on criticism from the United States administration over President Ramaphosas conduct at the summit, with the Presidency and other ministers defending South Africas approach to hosting the G twenty.

In political and legal headlines: the Zuma family dispute linked to recruitment of South Africans to fight in Ukraine. A criminal complaint was opened by Nkosazana Bonganini Zuma Mncube against her stepsister Duduzile Zuma Sambudla. The complaint centres on allegations that men were lured to Russia under false pretences and ended up on the front line in the Donbas region of Ukraine. Reporting indicates that as many as eighteen South African men are trapped in dangerous conditions there, describing explosions, drone activity, mine detonations and lack of medical care. Nkosazana filed an affidavit at a Sandton police station and the matter has been handed to the Hawks Crimes Against the State unit for further investigation. Authorities say the complaint will be examined and legal steps pursued where warranted. Listeners should note that independent verification remains ongoing and the investigation is active.

Turning to the economy and industry: the smelter closure crisis and its toll on mines and jobs. Reporting over the weekend detailed a collapse across the coal to smelter value chain. More than thirty mines have closed as smelters vanish from the market. The situation has left more than one million tonnes of anthracite coal stranded and has resulted in the loss of thousands of jobs. Affected mining communities include areas around Newcastle, Mtubatuba and Machadadorp. Municipalities and businesses are confronting the scale of stranded stockpiles and the social and economic fallout in mining towns. Authorities and industry representatives are calling for urgent interventions to stabilise supply chains and to support displaced workers and local economies.

On governance and procurement: a high value tender and questions over municipal pay. Weekend coverage flagged a three hundred and sixty million rand tender linked to Cat Matlala in a weekly wrap of major stories. At the same time, investigative reporting has highlighted soaring executive pay at the City of Johannesburg, describing increases that breach municipal rules even as service delivery collapses in parts of the city. The city administration has also been under pressure to sustain the service delivery gains that were visible during the G twenty showcase, with the mayor saying work will continue beyond the summit. These are developments to watch as legal and oversight processes consider procurement, remuneration and accountability. Journalists and watchdog groups say transparency will be key in restoring public trust.

Law enforcement and corruption news: arrests involving a Hawks officer. The Hawks and a suspended Tembisa Hospital official were arrested in a sting operation connected to alleged gratification payments. Reports say the arrests relate to approximately one hundred thousand rand and that an investigation is under way. Separately, other anti corruption operations continue across provinces as investigators pursue allegations of bribery and graft in public institutions. The National Prosecuting Authority and other agencies say they will follow the evidence and pursue prosecutions where warranted.

Finally, weather and safety reminders. Authorities warned of severe thunderstorms in several provinces over the coming days, and disaster management teams remain on alert, particularly in Kwa Zulu Natal and the Eastern Cape. If you are travelling or in vulnerable areas, follow local advisories and allow extra time on the roads. Stay clear of flooded roads and monitor local radio and municipal channels for updates.

That is the main news for South Africa this morning. Where fact checking was incomplete at the time of this recording, no specific corrections could be applied. Listeners are encouraged to check official sources and ongoing coverage for updates as investigations and diplomatic matters develop.

That is all for today.
