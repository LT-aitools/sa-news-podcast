Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A I host, Leah. Today is Tuesday, the twenty eighth of October, two thousand and twenty five.

First up: the Madlanga Commission and policing fallout. The commission of inquiry into allegations of corruption and political interference in the criminal justice system, known as the Madlanga Commission, continues to unpack troubling links between firearms, forensic reports and political players. At the commission this week, a ballistics expert told investigators it took him one day to link an AK forty seven rifle and a Taurus pistol used in the murder of engineer Armand Swart to three other high profile shootings, including the killings of DJs known as Sumbody and Vintos and a businessman, Don Tindleni. The testimony has raised questions about investigative capacity and chain of custody in cases involving lethal weapons, say legal analysts following the hearings. The commission has also exposed errors and confusion in forensic documentation, including an affidavit by a forensic analyst that cross referenced bullet and cartridge evidence in a way that caused concern among experts.

Meanwhile in Parliament, Deputy Police Minister Cassel Mathale appeared before an ad hoc committee probing allegations tied to senior police leadership. He told lawmakers that suspended Police Minister Senzo Mchunu had expressed unhappiness about the Political Killings Task Team, or PKTT, but Mathale said Mchunu did not issue a directive to disband the specialised unit. For listeners who are not familiar, the Political Killings Task Team is a specialised police unit set up to investigate politically motivated murders. Analysts say the exchange highlights tensions over how the state handles politically sensitive investigations and the future of units like the PKTT.

In KwaZulu Natal political and policing tensions are playing out publicly. Member of Parliament Fadiel Adams has laid perjury charges against KwaZulu Natal police commissioner Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi, a development that adds to a series of disputes involving senior South African Police Service officials. Provincial politics remain delicate, with reports that the Government of Provincial Unity coalition, involving the African National Congress, the Inkatha Freedom Party and other regional parties, is under pressure and that informal talks are under way among participants. These developments come as the province faces a separate social crisis. KwaZulu Natal premier Thami Ntuli has said approximately twenty six thousand girls were impregnated in an eight month period and has vowed tougher action against what he called predatory older men. Civil society groups have called for concrete measures to protect young women and to hold perpetrators to account.

Now to the Western Cape, where taxi violence has escalated. Authorities say another member of the Cape Amalgamated Taxi Association was gunned down, in a spate of attacks linked to contested routes and criminal rivalries. The killings have prompted the provincial government to warn that it will take tough action if shootings are connected to disputes over routes. Analysts and community leaders say the violence again raises the question of how to bring order to an industry that is vital to commuters yet has long been affected by turf wars. Cape Town officials and law enforcement face pressure to protect communities and prevent further bloodshed.

In Gauteng, the Mamelodi community is reeling after a double murder that shocked residents. Police have apprehended a suspect in connection with the killings of two young women, an event that activists say has renewed calls to tackle gender based violence. Civil society leaders and activists have urged stronger protections for women and swifter justice for perpetrators. The arrest is a step forward for investigators, but campaigners say systemic change is still urgently required.

In health news: South Africa has taken a major step in HIV prevention. Regulatory authorities have approved a long acting anti HIV injection, often described as a twice a year jab, that is expected to curb new infections. The product, lenacapavir, has been registered here, making South Africa the first country in Africa to do so. Health officials say an initial supply of the injection will arrive in November and that it will form part of efforts to accelerate prevention alongside testing and treatment programmes. Health advocates have welcomed the approval and are urging rapid rollout to reach populations at risk and to strengthen local responses to the epidemic.

Turning to business: WeBuyCars, one of South Africa s largest vehicle dealers, warned that earnings growth will slow and the market reacted immediately. The company s shares plunged, falling by more than one tenth on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange after the shock update on profit deceleration. Analysts are watching whether the flagging earnings signal broader cooling in consumer demand or company specific pressures in the motor retail sector. Investors and customers will be watching the company s full results when they are published.

Finally, governance and higher education remain on Parliament s agenda. Lawmakers have expressed alarm over governance crises at several universities, including concerns about infrastructure, student safety and the National Student Financial Aid Scheme. The higher education committee has signalled that it will continue scrutinising institutions and demanding answers as campuses prepare for the coming academic cycle.

That is the Mzansi Lowdown for this Tuesday. That is all for today.
