Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A I host, Leah. Today is the twenty sixth of December, two thousand twenty five.

First up, a plea for justice from Cape Town. The widow of cyclist Idries Sheriff has demanded answers after what News24 describes as her husband being robbed of his life. The report centres on the family calling for accountability and for authorities to pursue the case fully. It highlights ongoing concerns about road safety, violent crime and the toll taken on families after sudden and violent loss. The family want clear information about the circumstances that led to his death, and they are pressing for police to follow every lead and for prosecutors to seek a full accounting in court. We will watch for further updates as police investigations and any criminal proceedings are reported. For listeners, this is another reminder of how road and interpersonal violence reverberate through communities long after a single tragic event.

In legal and criminal justice news, News24 reports that a truck driver who has been accused in a fatal case is on the run after being granted bail. That development has left grieving families furious. The families have slammed the justice system for allowing bail, saying the decision undermines their trust and denies them closure. The report highlights the tension between court decisions and community expectations in high profile cases, particularly when suspects do not remain in custody. Authorities are now seeking the driver, and families continue to demand stronger responses from the justice system. Court officials and police are being urged to explain bail conditions and to strengthen measures that ensure accused people appear for trial. This story speaks to the wider challenge of balancing individual rights under the law with public safety and the needs of victims and their families.

Turning to road safety and the human cost of festive travel, multiple outlets report a spate of deadly crashes in Limpopo over the Christmas period. News24 says eleven people have been killed in three crashes since Christmas Eve, while IOL and SABC coverage focus on a head on collision on the N one national road that claimed two lives. Other reports detail collisions involving buses and heavy vehicles, and the death toll in some incidents rose as rescue and recovery efforts continued. Emergency services and provincial authorities described key routes being closed and communities mourning multiple losses. These incidents form part of a tragic pattern of road fatalities this festive season and they raise urgent questions about road safety enforcement, driver behaviour, vehicle standards and emergency response on national routes. Transport and policing authorities have been urged to intensify patrols, to enforce speed limits and to focus on driver fatigue and overloading in the days ahead.

A violent incident in a Mpumalanga tavern has left a DJ dead and prompted fresh concerns about tavern safety and firearm violence. EWN and TimesLive report that a thirty three year old DJ was shot dead on Christmas Eve by a patron after the music was switched off. The patron then turned the gun on himself. The incident is being treated as a murder suicide and has prompted arrests and a police inquiry according to follow up reporting. Families and local communities have expressed shock at the senseless loss, and the case will form part of investigations into how tavern violence can be prevented. Local authorities and community leaders are expected to review safety measures at licensed venues and to consider stricter enforcement of firearm regulations in entertainment precincts.

And another story of continued basic services failure: TimesLive reports that residents of Hammanskraal marked another Christmas without running water. According to the report, residents say they have been raising concerns for more than a decade and that promises of repairs and improvements have not been fulfilled. People described long walks to collect water, reliance on makeshift supply points and the daily stress of not having a reliable supply from their taps. The report notes longstanding pleas for help from residents who say they have lost hope of ever receiving clean water at home. This is another example of persistent service delivery failures affecting everyday life for communities outside major urban centres. It comes amid broader debates about municipal capacity, maintenance of infrastructure and government response to long term water crises. Listeners should know that this is not an isolated case, and similar challenges appear in several municipalities where resource constraints and governance problems prevent timely fixes.

A quick note on the business front. Daily Maverick has published a year in review video that looks back at South Africas business year, calling it one of optimism, drama and a late mini budget twist. The review traces how sentiment shifted through the year as economic debates and policy choices shaped the outlook for companies and households. It explores how firms responded to rising costs, how markets reacted to fiscal decisions and how policy signals affected investor confidence. For listeners tracking the economy, that summary offers useful context as authorities and markets head into the new year. It is a brief wrap up that helps explain some of the pressures many South African businesses and families faced over the past twelve months.

A brief editorial note. The items we covered today were chosen for their direct relevance to people in South Africa. We focused on local crime and justice developments, road safety during the festive season, tavern violence with local impact and a municipal services crisis that affects daily life for residents. Purely international stories were excluded unless they had a clear and direct link to South Africa. We aim to keep the programme centred on the issues that matter most at home.

That is the news for this afternoon. Please stay safe on the roads and look out for each other during this holiday stretch.

That is all for today,
