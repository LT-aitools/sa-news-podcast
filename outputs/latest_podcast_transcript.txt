First up: a major fallout at the Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Police Department. The City has suspended Deputy Chief of Police Julius Mkhwanazi. That suspension was announced on Tuesday, the eleventh of November, following testimony at the Madlanga ad hoc parliamentary committee, which is probing allegations of corruption and misconduct in the criminal justice system. Former deputy chief Revo Spies told investigators that fingerprint testing revealed two hundred and seventy-five metro police officers with criminal convictions, and that disciplinary processes were repeatedly blocked. Spies also said Mkhwanazi had assisted a security contractor, Vusimusi Cat Matlala, by enabling cars to be registered as EMPD vehicles and fitted with blue lights. City officials have opened a broader probe into the metro police and have announced a disciplinary hearing. Those revelations have led some former officials and observers to characterise the EMPD as operating in ways that resembled a criminal enterprise, an allegation attributed to an ex-official. Observers and analysts say the suspension is an immediate step, and that further accountability will depend on the outcomes of the disciplinary process and any criminal investigations.

In related coverage from Parliament and the justice sector, National Director of Public Prosecutions Shamila Batohi told Members of Parliament that there have been concerted attempts to compromise prosecutors and that South Africa is not winning the fight against organised crime. Batohi appeared before the ad hoc committee probing allegations of corruption in the criminal justice system and told MPs that institutions that defend the rule of law are under serious threat. She said prosecutors have been targeted, with some killed for doing their jobs, and that she learned of certain operational decisions, such as the disbandment of specialised units, through unofficial channels. When pressed to name a rogue prosecutor allegedly involved in criminal activity, Batohi declined to single out individuals. Her testimony drew sharp reactions in the chamber, including a critical exchange with EFF leader Julius Malema, who told her she was answering like a person who is going on retirement. The combination of Batohi s warnings and the EMPD evidence presented at the Madlanga committee underlines the depth of concern about corruption, capture and weakening law enforcement across parts of the system.

Turning to public health, South Africa has taken a step towards domestic vaccine capability. Clinical trials began for the first locally manufactured oral cholera vaccine, developed by Biovac. Government officials and health commentators have described the launch of these trials as a significant milestone and a potential game changer for outbreak response. Supporters say this development could reduce dependence on foreign pharmaceuticals and bring faster, targeted protection to rural communities that are vulnerable to cholera. Coverage notes that this is the first self-made vaccine trial in about fifty years, and stakeholders see it as an important advance for national health security. The trials are now underway, and health authorities and independent observers will assess the results to determine whether a wider roll-out is appropriate.

In the economy and jobs, the latest labour figures show a small but notable improvement in employment. Official statistics indicate that the unemployment rate fell to thirty-one point nine percent in the third quarter, down from thirty-three point two percent in the second quarter. That change reflects the creation of roughly two hundred and forty-eight thousand jobs during the period, with gains reported in construction, social services and trade. Analysts have pointed out that construction work helped to lower the jobless rate. While the numbers are an encouraging sign, analysts warn that unemployment remains deeply challenging, and that sustained economic growth and effective policy measures will be required to bring meaningful relief to millions of South Africans.

On a high-profile criminal case with national resonance, two brothers accused in the murder of rapper Kiernan AKA Forbes and Tebello Tibz Motsoane were extradited from Eswatini and have arrived in South Africa to face charges. The Ndimande brothers return follows a lengthy legal process and has prompted emotional public reactions. The mother of the slain rapper, Lynn Forbes, spoke publicly and described the return of the suspects and the ongoing investigation as suffocating, and she urged authorities to pursue justice. Authorities in KwaZulu Natal say investigations continue and that police remain focused on identifying the alleged mastermind behind the killing. The case remains before the courts and will continue to attract close attention as it moves through the legal process.

In community news, environmental volunteers and activists continue to lead local clean up efforts across Gauteng and Limpopo. One profile highlighted community organiser Cetric Mphofela, founder of the Cetric Mphofela Foundation, who has led clean ups in rivers and informal settlements and who plans a long walk across the country to raise awareness about conservation and collective responsibility. The story is a reminder that amid national challenges many South Africans are stepping up at grassroots level to keep places livable and to protect natural resources.

That is the Mzansi Lowdown for today.

That is all for today.
