Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your AI host, Leah. Today is Monday, the twelfth of January, two thousand and twenty-six.

First up: controversy in the arts. Sports, Arts and Culture Minister Gayton McKenzie has cancelled the South Africas submission to the Venice Biennale. The work in question reportedly alludes to what some describe as a genocide in Gaza. Critics say the ministers decision infringes on the right to freedom of expression. The cancellation has prompted accusations that government action is curbing artistic freedom, and that cultural institutions and artists have been denied a space for a politically charged work on the international stage. This development has sparked a wider debate about censorship, the role of the state in cultural expression, and where the line is drawn between official policy and artistic independence. Reporting from domestic outlets has emphasised the sensitivity of presenting politically charged material at a high profile international art event, and the story continues to generate reaction from artists, curators and free expression advocates.

In national governance, President Cyril Ramaphosa has signalled a renewed push on municipalities. He has vowed decisive action in two thousand and twenty-six to revive failing local governments, saying that fixing local government is a priority for the African National Congress as it seeks to arrest voter decline. The president framed the restoration of municipal services as central to the party strategy ahead of elections, and the promise is to act swiftly or face the consequences at the ballot box. Coverage describes this plan as a municipal reboot aimed at shoring up service delivery, addressing infrastructure backlogs, and stemming public disillusionment with local government. Political analysts say implementation will require co ordination between national and provincial departments, additional funding and expanded oversight to be effective.

Related to governance and oversight, the appointment of Andy Mothibi as head of the National Prosecuting Authority has provoked debate. Some business commentators welcomed Mothibis appointment but said he must be equipped with sufficient resources to succeed. Others have warned the presidents surprise move recalls past eras when executive influence over prosecutorial appointments went largely unchecked. Analysis in the press described the appointment as a curveball that exposes risky presidential power and has fuelled calls for greater transparency in appointments. The Democratic Alliance has taken legal steps seeking access to the report on the selection process for the National Director of Public Prosecutions, and there have been calls for stronger, more transparent procedures to prevent executive overreach. At the same time, commentators note expectations that Mothibi, with experience in the private sector and investigative units, must be supported to tackle corruption and to restore public confidence in the prosecuting authority.

In local politics, the Democratic Alliance mayoral plans in Johannesburg are taking shape around veteran politician Helen Zille. Reports indicate Zille could join the metropolitan council as early as March, provided a proportional representative vacancy opens up following recent resignations and a by election in Randburg. She says a friend persuaded her to stand, and she views this move as a first step toward a potential run for Johannesburg mayor before the municipal elections at the end of the year. The development points to a fast tracked plan by the DA to position a high profile candidate well ahead of the campaign season, and it raises questions about strategy, timing and the party prospects in the countrys largest city. Political commentators are watching whether this will galvanise supporters or provoke further debate within opposition ranks.

Turning to weather and the environment, Kruger National Park has been managing severe weather impacts. The park has evacuated camps after Level Six severe weather warnings affected Limpopo and Mpumalanga provinces. Park officials relocated campers to less saturated areas and monitored conditions to ensure visitor safety as heavy rains hit the region. Local reporting noted that two Kruger gates were temporarily closed following heavy rains, with staff relocating guests to reduce risk and to protect vehicles and infrastructure. This comes amid broader severe weather alerts across the provinces and underlines the ongoing challenges the park faces during extreme weather events, both for visitor safety and for conservation operations. Authorities have urged residents and visitors to heed warnings and to expect further operational adjustments while emergency assessments continue.

A quick note on education: the Independent Examinations Board reported a high pass rate for its Class of two thousand and twenty five, with an overall pass rate of ninety eight point three one percent. The Independent Examinations Board chief executive said that standards were maintained and that university access remained strong, with one hundred and sixty one pupils achieving distinctions in all seven subjects. This IEB picture comes ahead of the national matriculant announcements later this month, and education stakeholders are watching how private and public results compare as learners seek placement and support for further study.

Finally, a brief item on public finances and scrutiny. There has been reporting and commentary about government travel expenses and transparency around appointments and spending. Some civic voices are pressing for clearer accounting and for presidential decisions, particularly on high profile appointments, to be accompanied by full disclosure. These themes are running through coverage of the National Director of Public Prosecutions appointment, the municipal promises and ongoing questions over public spending. Accountability groups continue to call for stronger oversight mechanisms and for budgets and expense reports to be published in formats that allow for independent verification.

That is the main news for today.

That is all for today.
