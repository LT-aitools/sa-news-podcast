First up: at the African National Congress National General Council this week the party has named President Cyril Ramaphosa to lead its local government election campaign for two thousand twenty six. Delegates used the closing sessions of the gathering to underline the ANC commitment to transformation policies, including defending the National Health Insurance and black economic empowerment as non negotiable priorities. The council framed this as part of the party renewal project, praising members who stepped aside over integrity concerns and signalling a push to transform structures ahead of the two thousand twenty seven national conference.

The National General Council tone was firm. The ANC intends to steer the transformation agenda even as it seeks working relations with governing partners in the national unity government. That stance has produced friction with the South African Communist Party and the council resolved to bar S A C P representatives from taking part in ANC election strategy meetings after the S A C P signalled it may contest elections independently of the tripartite alliance. These are significant political moves with implications for alliance dynamics as the country heads into an intense local election year.

Turning to the National Prosecuting Authority appointment process interviews for the next National Director of Public Prosecutions concluded this week with three final candidates taking the hot seat — Hermione Cronje Xolisile Khanyile and Menzi Simelane. The hearings produced sharp moments. Hermione Cronje the former head of the Investigating Directorate told the advisory panel that the N P A is fixable but only if the deep crises within the institution are confronted head on. She laid partial blame at the feet of Menzi Simelane accusing him of contributing to divisions at the N P A. Menzi Simelane meanwhile admitted previously blocking the prosecution of Bosasa on the grounds that he did not trust the investigative unit involved.

Separately prominent advocate Tembeka Ngcukaitobi publicly accused National Director of Public Prosecutions Shamila Batohi of lying under oath over whether an expert adviser had been involved in evidence related to former spyboss Richard Mdluli. Shamila Batohi has defended her record in the interviews and told the inquiry panel she had no reason to mislead it though parts of her handling of related matters have come under scrutiny. The appointment panel and the President advisers now face a fraught choice: who is best placed to stabilise prosecutions rebuild credibility and carry out high risk high profile matters without political interference.
