First up: unfolding testimony and growing alarm over what senior journalists are calling a noxious nexus between politics, policing and criminality. Evidence presented this week at the Madlanga Commission and in parliamentary ad hoc committee hearings has focused attention on allegations that senior police figures and political actors have been entangled with criminal networks. News24 parliamentary reporter Jan Gerber writes that testimony before both forums delivers shocking revelations and exposes how deep the connections appear to run. The Sunday Times and TimesLive have carried related reporting, including witness accounts that implicate public officials and city managers in shielding or enabling rogue actors. One Sunday Times story details how an Ekurhuleni city manager went to considerable lengths to protect a rogue metro police officer, while other pieces highlight whistleblowers and victims of alleged corrupt collusion. The tenor of coverage is that South African institutions are under stress. Inquiries are revealing alleged collusion, and journalists and civil servants are framing whistleblowing as an act of social responsibility. These hearings will be critical for accountability going forward, and they are likely to shape public debate and possible prosecutions.

In government and accountability news: investigators from the Special Investigating Unit and the Hawks are now targeting figures connected to Denel who are linked to long standing Gupta era networks. News24 reports that probes are looking at what are described as Gupta cronies involved with defence sector contracts and dealings. The work of the Special Investigating Unit and the Hawks follows broader findings and concerns about mismanagement and alleged corruption in the defence department. Political parties are demanding accountability, and oversight committees are pressing for answers as the probes expose loss and alleged misuse of public funds. Reports emphasise that oversight institutions are under pressure to act decisively and to recover any public money lost. The outcomes of these investigations could have implications for procurement practices and for who faces charges in years to come.

In economic news: South Africa has received its first sovereign credit rating upgrade in decades. International outlets carried the story that ratings agencies have improved the country outlook, with some calling it the first upgrade in roughly twenty years or the first in twenty five years, depending on the source. Reporting notes that this upgrade reflects fiscal reforms, progress on stabilising debt, and a medium term plan that markets have welcomed. Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana and finance commentators framed the development as a sign that policy shifts are gaining traction and investor confidence is improving. Business publications covered reactions from ratings agencies, who welcomed fiscal shifts presented in the medium term budget policy statement that target debt stabilisation. Analysts and government voices urged caution, noting that further reform and implementation will be needed to lock in gains. The upgrade is likely to influence borrowing costs and investor sentiment in the coming months, and policymakers will be watching whether the improvement translates into tangible investment and job creation.

Next: the G twenty summit that South Africa is hosting is reshaping life in Johannesburg this week, and it is stirring controversy. City officials have been clearing the streets ahead of the summit, drawing criticism from advocacy groups and media. Daily Maverick reported that homeless people were told to go home as the City of Johannesburg cleared public spaces in preparation for visiting delegates. Related reporting in TimesLive and the Sunday Times details heavy logistical preparations, including a large diversion of municipal funds. The Sunday Times reports that Johannesburg has diverted four billion rand from its capital expenditure budget to head off potential worker protests and disruptions connected to the summit. That reallocation is framed as a pre emptive move to prevent strikes or demonstrations affecting the event, but it raises questions about long term cost and priorities for the city. The coverage highlights tensions between hosting a major international summit and meeting local service and welfare obligations. Residents and civil society groups say the city must balance international obligations with basic service delivery for residents.

Finally: a human story from beyond the capital and the courts, centred on displaced Gazans who arrived in South Africa on an unannounced flight. News outlets including News24 and the Sunday Times reported that more than three hundred Palestinians landed at OR Tambo International Airport on a mystery plane. The coverage says many paid steep sums to secure passage and that the dispatch has prompted diplomatic and domestic debate. International partners and local officials have been cited as saying that the arrivals were granted entry, while political commentary in the Sunday Times suggested the episode is being used in information campaigns aimed at discrediting South Africa on the world stage. The immediate focus is on verifying the circumstances of their arrival, the humanitarian needs of those travellers, and the political fallout both at home and abroad. Humanitarian groups and government officials are working to confirm documentation, arrange temporary support, and to determine next steps for those who arrived.
