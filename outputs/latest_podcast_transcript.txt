Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your AI host, Leah. Today is eight December two thousand and twenty five. Straight to the headlines.

First up: the murder of Madlanga Commission witness Marius van der Merwe, known in reports as Witness D, is dominating headlines and raising fresh concerns about the safety of people who testify in high profile probes. His partner wrote, I have lost my love; my children have lost their father and our country a hero, after he was killed. Security officials have been consistent in pointing to two possible motives: his recent testimony before the Madlanga Commission and his reported role in the removal of a camp from which illegal miners operated.

Reports say CCTV footage shows the whistle blower talking to his killers before he was murdered, and investigators note he had survived two previous assassination attempts. The killing is reverberating across the state. President Cyril Ramaphosa warned that Witness Ds death will deter other witnesses from coming forward. The Justice Minister faced backlash for suggesting the media may have played a role by publicising that the victim was a commission witness, asking how the public knew his identity and implying leaks may have helped those who targeted him.

Newspapers and commentators describe the murder as a blow to truth and accountability and say it expands a sinister web of kidnappings, threats and intimidation linked to police capture hearings. Police have opened investigations but as of the latest reports there have been no arrests. The killing has prompted renewed calls for stronger witness protection measures and for urgent action to safeguard people involved in high profile commissions and prosecutions.

In politics: the African National Congress National General Council has opened in Johannesburg and, as expected, questions about leadership and succession are front and centre. Delegates will meet through the week to review party performance and to debate renewal, including how to manage leadership succession. The agenda includes policy implementation, unpaid salaries in some municipalities, and broader issues such as inequality and corruption.

Analysts say a change of top leadership is unlikely despite whispering campaigns, but the conference is being treated as a critical moment for the ANC to regain relevance and moral authority. Inside the ANC, sources say leaders are moving to steady President Ramaphosa amid murmurings of removal and growing tensions over coalition partners. Commentators and party insiders frame the National General Council as an attempt to reassure the president and to present a united front while grappling with the practical challenges of governance and rebuilding credibility.

The Daily Maverick and other outlets have framed this meeting as pivotal for whether the party can translate internal debate into coherent policy and effective leadership transition planning. Delegates are expected to debate both short term fixes and longer term strategies for restoring public trust and improving service delivery to communities across the country.

In governance and public administration: Home Affairs has revoked the ninety day visa exemption for holders of ordinary Palestinian passports. The department says the decision follows a probe into alleged abuse of a charter flight exemption and what it described as systematic exploitation of the visa free period. Officials cited concerns about people arriving under the exemption and not complying with the intended terms. Media reports indicate the revocation was prompted by evidence of organised efforts to exploit the exemption for longer stays.

The change has sparked commentary about policy and principle. Critics say the move will raise questions about South Africas stance on Palestinian travellers and the balance between immigration control and diplomatic positions. Government officials stress the need to protect the integrity of immigration processes and to prevent exploitation of visa arrangements. The matter continues to draw attention from rights groups and community leaders, who are calling for clarity on how affected travellers will be treated and on what measures will be put in place to manage any humanitarian concerns.

In law and prosecutions: interviews to appoint the new head of the National Prosecuting Authority begin this week. The process includes several candidates and continues to attract controversy because one prominent applicant, Menzi Simelane, remains in contention despite public opposition. Freedom Under Law has formally opposed Simelanes candidacy and media reports say the matter will be scrutinised closely as the selection panel proceeds.

The new director of public prosecutions will face a prosecution service still under pressure to rebuild public trust and to demonstrate independence in high profile matters. Observers note that the selection process itself will be a test of transparency and of the institutions tasked with upholding the rule of law. Stakeholders from civil society and the legal profession are expected to submit inputs and to watch the appointments closely.

A local legal and medical controversy has also emerged in Stellenbosch. Dr Pieter Henning, a radiologist and co founder of a private radiology firm, has been arrested after an incident in which he allegedly fired shots at a business premises while reportedly intoxicated. Separately, he faces allegations of opioid abuse, specifically pethidine, allegations he denies and calls an attempt to damage his reputation.

Mediclinic says it will consider the matter internally, while the Health Professions Council of South Africa has confirmed impairment allegations will go before its health committee next month. The story has raised questions about practitioner impairment, employer responsibilities and professional oversight in health care. Legal experts say the outcomes of the criminal process and the professional fitness to practise inquiry will both be important in setting precedents for how similar cases are handled in future.
