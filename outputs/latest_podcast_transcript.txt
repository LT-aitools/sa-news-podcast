Howzit South Africa and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your AI host Leah. Today is eight January two thousand and twenty six. Coming up: a contentious appointment at the National Prosecuting Authority, a shock decision at the Johannesburg council, a medical first for cardiology in South Africa, the Department of Basic Education move on matric results, and the fire emergency in Mossel Bay.

First up, accountability and the National Prosecuting Authority. President Cyril Ramaphosa has appointed Advocate Andy Mothibi as National Director of Public Prosecutions. The appointment follows an interview panel report that was said to have found all six candidates unsuitable for the post. The Presidency says it will not release that panel report, arguing the document was not intended to potentially malign individuals. That refusal has prompted pushback. The Democratic Alliance has said it will pursue legal avenues to obtain the report. At the same time, outgoing NPA head Shamila Batohi has publicly backed her successor, providing a handover that reportedly includes a comprehensive report on risks and unfinished work at the NPA. The situation raises questions about transparency in the appointment process, the length of Mothibis tenure — he is expected to retire in three years at age sixty two — and the scrutiny that will follow his arrival at the helm of prosecutions.

In municipal finance: Johannesburg council stunned observers this week by approving the writing off of eight hundred sixty eight million rand in unauthorised, irregular and wasteful expenditure. Council members reportedly applauded the decision. Departments such as public safety and group risk were named among the main culprits. Critics have condemned the move on both moral and practical grounds, warning that the loss of such funds undermines service delivery and weakens accountability. The write off adds to a growing list of governance challenges that municipal authorities face and will likely feed into calls for tighter financial discipline and oversight. Observers say the council will need to show how services will be protected while measures are put in place to prevent a repeat of similar losses.

In health and science: South African cardiologists have achieved a national first by successfully implanting the countrys first leadless pacemaker. The device is described as tiny, a fraction of the size of a triple A battery, and was fitted using minimally invasive techniques that eliminate the need for surgical incisions and lead wires. Medical teams say the breakthrough offers patients a safer, more discreet option for managing cardiac rhythms and highlights local advanced clinical capability. The report on the procedure referenced Netcare and signals what doctors describe as an important step forward for cardiac care access and innovation in South Africa. Cardiologists involved say the technology could reduce complications associated with traditional pacemakers and expand treatment options for patients in both private and public settings.

In education: the Department of Basic Education has confirmed it will publish the two thousand and twenty five National Senior Certificate matriculation results despite an appeal by the Information Regulator. The decision to proceed comes amid broader concerns about data handling and transparency. Mental health organisations have urged parents to maintain a positive environment while learners await their results, reflecting the anxiety that surrounds release time each year. The departments move to publish will end weeks of speculation and will set the timetable for final admissions and financial aid decisions as students prepare for the academic year ahead. Schools, universities and funding bodies are preparing for a surge of activity when results are released, and the department says it will communicate clearly about the release process and support services for learners.

On the emergency and environment beat: a major blaze in Mossel Bay has forced large scale evacuations and left firefighters injured. The wildfire prompted evacuation of families and disrupted communities in the Garden Route district. At least three firefighters were reported injured, with one hospitalised for smoke inhalation. The fire also damaged infrastructure, including a privately owned boat in the Garden Route National Park, leading to the indefinite closure of a launch site, and prompted coordinated firefighting efforts across the district. Local authorities and social development services are providing support to displaced residents and coordinating containment operations. Coverage notes ongoing risks as firefighters and communities grapple with the aftermath, and officials are urging residents to follow evacuation orders and to stay clear of affected areas while recovery continues.

A quick roundup of other South African developments to watch: Transnet has issued a tender call seeking advanced technology to combat organised cargo theft; Icasa is moving to allow the rollover of unused mobile data bundles; and the Transport Department has been allowed by the court to outsource the printing and issuing of driving licence cards to Home Affairs as an interim measure following a ruling that a previous tender award was unlawful. These are operational details that could affect daily life and commerce in the weeks ahead. Keep an eye on how these measures will be implemented and any timelines announced by the respective departments.

That is your Mzansi Lowdown for today.

That is all for today
