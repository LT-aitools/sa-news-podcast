Howzit South Africas, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A I host, Leah. Today is eleven November two thousand and twenty five.

First up: the trial of Duduzile Zuma-Sambudla opened in Durban this week. Zuma-Sambudla, a member of parliament for the MK Party, pleaded not guilty as her high court hearing began. The MK Party is the uMkhonto weSizwe Party associated with former president Jacob Zuma. The State says her social media posts deliberately and unlawfully inflamed public unrest linked to the July two thousand and twenty one riots, which killed many and cost the economy billions of rand. Defence lawyers told the court they had concerns that the state had been surveilling their client well before the unrest. Legal observers say the case will be closely watched for its evidentiary record and for questions it raises about political speech and accountability.

Next: developments involving the Madlanga Commission and a separate parliamentary oversight process. Parliament is preparing to travel to Kgosi Mampuru maximum security prison in Pretoria to hear oral evidence from Vusimuzi Cat Matlala. That visit is part of a parliamentary ad hoc committee inquiry into alleged wrongdoing linked to policing. Separately, the Madlanga Commission has been hearing dramatic allegations about rogue activity inside the Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Police Department, including claims of extortion, kidnapping, theft and torture. The commission heard that a whistleblower was reportedly murdered after exposing an unlawful operation, and that CCTV evidence ties an EMPD brigadier to an alleged copper theft raid. Police have reportedly resisted aspects of the planned testimony to the parliamentary committee, creating logistical and security friction. Observers note these are related but distinct oversight processes, highlighting the complexity of investigating alleged criminal conduct inside law enforcement agencies.

In national security news with international consequences: families say seventeen South African men were sent to Russia by the MK Party for what they were told was bodyguard training, but they have since been stuck on the frontline of the war in Ukraine. The men are believed to be in the Donbas region and are reportedly being kept in poor conditions. In a letter that appears to bear Jacob Zuma signature, the former president pleads with the Russian defence minister to move the men to a safer location. Families describe the situation as a grave betrayal and have called for urgent consular and diplomatic action.

Turning to municipal finances: Johannesburg Water headline debt has surged again, topping one billion rand. The city admitted to overdue payments and blamed administrative delays, while water campaigners and critics have accused officials of creative accounting. Activists warn that the financial squeeze threatens vital water infrastructure and have renewed calls for transparency and ringfenced funding to keep water services running. Their argument is that the risk is not only financial but also about the sustainability of basic services for millions of residents.

In national transport policy: the rollout of the Administrative Adjudication of Road Traffic Offences system, known as Aarto, has been postponed again. The transport minister has deferred implementation to the first of July two thousand and twenty six, citing that municipalities are not prepared for the new road traffic regime. This is another delay in a reform process that has been unfolding for many years, forcing municipalities, road user groups and the private sector to recalibrate plans around demerit systems and enforcement timelines.

A lighter note from the arts: South African flautist Khanyisile Mthetwa has been named a semifinalist in the Petrichor International Music Competition, placing her among top international artists and ensembles. Her debut album, titled African Bird, impressed the Petrichor jury with its blend of African identity, classical technique and social consciousness. Critics have called the record genre defying and timeless, and the recognition underlines a string of recent successes for South African classical musicians on global stages.

Those are the headlines making news around the country this morning: a high profile trial in Durban connected to social media posts tied to the July two thousand and twenty one unrest, distinct but related hearings at the Madlanga Commission and a parliamentary ad hoc committee, seventeen South Africans reportedly trapped in a foreign conflict after misleading recruitment, a growing water debt in Johannesburg, another Aarto postponement, and an international nod for a homegrown musician.

That is all for today,
