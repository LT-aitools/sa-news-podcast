Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your AI host, Leah. Today is the twenty seventh of November, two thousand and twenty five.

First up: explosive testimony from behind bars. Tenderpreneur Vusimuzi Cat Matlala has appeared before Parliament ad hoc committee at Kgosi Mampuru Correctional Facility and dropped serious allegations about a former police minister. Matlala told members he handed five hundred thousand rand to former police minister Bheki Cele, saying three hundred thousand rand was paid at Matlala's Pretoria penthouse and two hundred thousand rand was later handed over at a hotel in KwaZulu Natal. He also accused the former minister of continuing to ask for money after that payment and said he stopped taking the ministers calls when he realised the demands would not end. Matlala further accused the former minister of lying under oath about their relationship.

Matlala's appearance has stirred sharp reactions inside Parliament. He presented an unsigned witness statement while answering questions about contracts, raids on his properties and his alleged role as a central figure in a wider corruption probe. Lawmakers are probing claims that criminal syndicates have infiltrated policing and political structures in KwaZulu Natal. The atmosphere in the hearings is tense, and the committee's work is expected to keep drawing headlines as members push to establish whether any further action is warranted.

Next: a separate, high profile arrest has placed the judiciary under fresh scrutiny. A Gauteng High Court judge was arrested on corruption charges connected to a succession dispute in a religious organisation. Authorities allege the judge received more than two million rand in kickbacks to rule in favour of one faction in that succession battle. Civil society group Judges Matter has called for the judge to step down and for suspension pending the outcome of investigations.

The case has broader implications for public confidence in the courts. Judicial leadership has noted a rise in complaints against members of the bench over recent years, and commentators are urging swift, transparent processes so trust in the judiciary is not further eroded. The arrested judge has reportedly claimed the charges amount to a vendetta. Family members of victims in unrelated murder trials have expressed concern about the completion of their matters, given the judge was presiding over ongoing cases. The Hawks and other oversight bodies are continuing their investigations, and a bail hearing was reported in connection with the matter.

In governance and oversight news: Parliament powerful oversight committees are turning up the pressure. The Standing Committee on Public Accounts, Scopa, plans to write to the Speaker of the National Assembly seeking that charges be brought against former Road Accident Fund chief executive Collins Letsoalo after he failed to appear at a probe. The move signals growing impatience in Parliament with officials who do not cooperate with accountability processes. Separately, the ad hoc committee that is hearing Matlala testimony is attempting to untangle allegations that procurement and policing in KwaZulu Natal have been compromised by syndicates and that political structures were targeted.

These developments come as calls grow for stronger institutional checks and for the rule of law to be enforced without fear or favour. Members of Parliament and oversight bodies are making clear they will not treat non attendance lightly, and that prosecution recommendations will be pursued where evidence and accountability gaps are identified.

Turning to agriculture and biosecurity: Agriculture Minister John Steenhuisen has announced a major policy shift in response to an escalating foot and mouth disease crisis. Government will implement a blanket vaccination of the national herd, covering seven point two million cattle. Officials say vaccination will start immediately, prioritising provinces deemed most at risk. The minister described the campaign as necessary because current containment efforts are not winning the battle against the disease. The plan marks a significant intervention intended to protect livestock, livelihoods and trade, and it will require a large, coordinated roll out across multiple provinces starting early next year.

The vaccination drive will carry heavy logistical and financial demands, and farmers and industry stakeholders will be watching closely. The move acknowledges the seriousness of the outbreak and signals that authorities are willing to take decisive, nationwide steps to stop further spread.

Finally, in public finance and tourism oversight: the Department of Tourism and SA Tourism remain under the microscope after revelations about lingering payments related to Tottenham dealmakers. Reports indicate that SA Tourism still owes millions to dealmakers involved in its five year relationship with an external agency, and President Cyril Ramaphosa has ordered a probe into alleged maladministration and phantom service payments. The Special Investigating Unit is expected to examine contracts and payments as questions mount about accountability and value for public money.

The presidents directive to investigate comes as criticism grows about governance at state agencies and the need for more transparent procurement and payment processes. Officials have been asked to provide full details as investigators seek to establish whether funds were properly authorised and whether any misconduct took place.

That is the state of play in South African news this morning: the Matlala testimony and the claims against a former police minister; the arrest of a High Court judge and calls for judicial accountability; parliamentary oversight pushing for prosecutions and answers; a nationwide foot and mouth vaccination campaign covering seven point two million cattle; and a presidential order for investigations into SA Tourism payments.

That is all for today.
