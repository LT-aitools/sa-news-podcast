Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your AI host Leah. Today is Wednesday, twenty fourth of December, two thousand and twenty five.

First up, in economic and energy news: a year of big swings for South Africa. Business Maverick sums up two thousand and twenty five as a roller coaster for business. The year began with an optimistic milestone — Eskom reached three hundred consecutive days without load shedding, the first time the country has seen such a stretch since two thousand and eighteen. That respite translated into tangible relief for businesses and households, from longer trading hours to lower diesel bills and fewer delivery delays. Small and medium enterprises in particular reported improved sales and reduced contingency costs during that period.

But the calm has not been without turbulence. The national Budget process under the Government of National Unity stalled on multiple occasions. Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana had to rework his proposals after a failed attempt in February and a second try in March, with a final successful tabling only in May. A proposed one percent increase in value added tax was a key flashpoint and ultimately was abandoned. Treasury then cut provisional spending by sixty eight billion rand and relied on fiscal drag — freezing personal tax brackets to harvest forty nine point four billion rand — to balance the books. Earlier in the year an unresolved shortfall of twenty eight billion rand added pressure and urgency to those political negotiations. The budget adjustments will have knock on effects for service delivery and public investment plans into the coming financial year.

In follow up to the reform story: ratings and monetary policy. Business Maverick reports that South Africa secured its first credit ratings upgrade in two decades during two thousand and twenty five, a development the outlet links to gains from Eskom stability and broader reforms. Credit markets welcomed the news as a sign of lower sovereign risk, which could reduce borrowing costs over time. And in a notable policy shift, the Reserve Bank and National Treasury moved to reduce the inflation target to three percent, with a tolerance band of one percentage point. That repricing of inflation objectives will be watched closely by markets and households, since it can affect interest rates, mortgage costs and the affordability of consumer credit. Economists will be monitoring the impact on investment, employment and wage growth in the year ahead.

Turning to state and aviation oversight: the investigation into South African Airways has been broadened. Reporting from News24 and Business Day says the Special Investigating Unit probe into SAA has expanded to examine suspected wrongdoing stretching back more than two decades. The scope now includes a wider set of allegations, from complex currency deals to alleged kickbacks, as authorities seek to piece together long term patterns of mismanagement and corruption at the national carrier. The expansion follows public concern about how state resources were used and adds to the list of accountability processes political leaders say they are pursuing. The broader probe may lead to criminal and civil actions as investigators build cases and attempt to recover public funds.

On corruption tied to arts funding: the Special Investigating Unit has obtained a preservation order to freeze residential property linked to the late actor Presley Chweneyagae and his wife. The SIU says the house is alleged to have been bought using about eight hundred and eighty nine thousand rand that was siphoned from a fifteen million rand National Lotteries Commission grant earmarked for youth arts programmes. Multiple outlets report that the property is now frozen as part of investigations into the wider fifteen million rand NLC fraud case. This is another example of probes reaching into public grant spending and into high profile names, even where the alleged offences relate to cultural and community projects. Authorities say the aim is both to hold individuals to account and to restore funds to community programmes.

And on weather and public safety: rescue teams in Tshwane recovered two bodies from the Hennops River after a vehicle was swept away during heavy downpours over the weekend. City of Tshwane emergency services led the recovery operation after rising water levels and strong currents created extremely dangerous conditions. Search and rescue operations had been underway as authorities dealt with flooding impacts in the region. Local officials reminded residents to avoid floodplains and to follow warnings from emergency services during storms. Our thoughts are with the families affected and with emergency workers who responded.

A quick consumer alert from the motor sector: WeBuyCars, the online used car marketplace, has faced significant penalties this season in consumer protection cases. Reporting across News24, EWN and Moneyweb notes the company agreed to pay a two point five million rand fine and three point four million rand in consumer redress in one settlement, and other coverage puts the combined penalties and redress at five point nine million rand. Regulators have accused the company of breaches of the Consumer Protection Act, including failing to disclose vehicle histories and not meeting guarantee requirements. The fines underline growing regulatory scrutiny of the used car market and signal increased enforcement activity to protect buyers.
