Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A I host, Leah. Today is thirty October two thousand and twenty five, South African Standard Time.

First up: fresh testimony at the Madlanga commission of inquiry into alleged corruption in the criminal justice system. This week Hawks officials were called to account. Brigadier Lesiba Mokoena and Captain Barry Kruger were questioned over their involvement in the operation that led to the arrest of alleged cartel leader Katiso Molefe, also known as KT Molefe. Witnesses told the commission that teams went to the house of Molefe during the takedown to verify whether officers on the scene were legitimate Hawks members. Evidence presented to the inquiry included that a rifle and ammunition were found at the house of Molefe on the day of the arrest. Testimony also revealed that police accounts described Molefe as a friend of Senzo Mchunu, a detail that has drawn attention in the ongoing hearings.

The Madlanga commission is examining a range of allegations about corruption, misconduct and systemic failures in the criminal justice system, including how operations are authorised and how forensics and chain of command issues affect prosecutions. Evidence at the hearings has also highlighted a massive ballistics backlog at the South African Police Service, with more than forty one thousand criminal cases held up by delays and staff shortages. That backlog undermines prosecutions and public confidence in investigations. Expect further testimony and scrutiny as the inquiry continues.

In Bloemfontein, the latest incident in the string of targeted killings that has affected the Mangaung Metropolitan Municipality. Gunmen have executed another employee linked to the municipality and its electricity entity, Centlec. The latest victim, Mbuyiselo Sarel May, raises the number of Mangaung and Centlec workers killed in hit style attacks to four over the past three years. Centlec and Mangaung officials have expressed alarm and called for urgent attention to the safety of municipal employees.

These killings sit alongside other high profile cases being investigated nationally and underline a pattern of violence that municipal leaders say must be addressed. The targeted nature of the attacks and the frequency over a short period have prompted internal concern and demands for coordinated action from policing structures. We will watch for developments, including arrests, protective measures for staff, and any statements from national law enforcement leadership.

In health news: South Africa has become the first African country to register the long acting anti HIV injection lenacapavir. Health authorities approved the twice a year jab after an accelerated process, marking a potentially significant addition to HIV prevention and treatment options in the country. Reports describe lenacapavir as a long acting injection that will be given twice a year and say the registration happened at record speed.

The registration has been highlighted across government and media outlets as an important milestone. Experts and officials say the jab could curb new infections by improving adherence and offering an alternative to daily tablets. At the same time, other coverage flags broader concerns about funding and service delivery. Community monitoring groups have sounded alarms about service delivery declines as international donor support shifts. We will be watching how rollout plans, supply chains and funding arrangements evolve to ensure access beyond urban centres.

Related to health system strains: Ritshidze monitoring, the community led system tracking primary health services, has flagged severe service slide across provinces. Reports show clinics in Gauteng, KwaZulu Natal and the Eastern Cape facing staff shortages and declining services following cuts to P E P F A R funding. P E P F A R is the United States President s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. More than ninety percent of clinics in some networks reported problems that affect basic care. Medical briefs and editorials warn of the pitfalls of shrinking donor support without realistic domestic plans to pick up the shortfall.

These monitoring findings combine with other on the ground reports — for example, an acute infrastructure failure in a regional hospital where All Saints Hospital has reportedly been without water for three weeks — to paint a picture of a health system under pressure. The withdrawal or reduction of key external funds adds urgency to national discussions about sustainable financing, workforce planning and oversight of public healthcare delivery.

Finally, a local story from Potchefstroom. A young group of locals, sparked into action by twenty two year old Peterson Sebati, have been cleaning and renovating public spaces across the city at no cost. They started by restoring parks, bus stops, taxi ranks, post offices and schools after becoming fed up with deteriorating public services. To sustain the work, Sebati established an N G O called Retsa Tsela, which means pave a way, to formalise the group s efforts and raise support. The initiative was showcased on social media and has attracted attention for demonstrating community led solutions where service delivery has faltered.

The Potchefstroom volunteers show how citizens are stepping in to keep communities functioning when municipal services lag. Their work has attracted support and online interest, and organisers say they hope to build partnerships to sustain and scale up their work.
