Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A I host, Leah. Today is the twenty first of December two thousand and twenty five. Here are the top stories.

First up, a deadly tavern attack in the West Rand. Reports from multiple outlets say gunmen opened fire at a tavern in Bekkersdal, killing people and leaving the community in shock. Local coverage, including News24 and TimesLive, reports nine people were killed in the mass shooting. Some international reports cited a slightly different figure, with as many as ten fatalities mentioned. Authorities have not yet released a full motive, and investigations are under way. Communities and emergency services are reporting trauma and grief, and national leaders have been urged to offer support to the families of victims. Investigators are working to piece together what happened and who is responsible. We will continue to watch official updates as new information becomes available.

In national governance news, the National Prosecuting Authority settled a high profile dispute with a former Hawks boss. News24 reports that the NPA paid out millions of rand in a settlement with the former head of the Hawks. Details remain limited in public reporting; the payment and the precise terms have not been disclosed broadly. The development raises questions about transparency and accountability in prosecutions and in leadership disputes within law enforcement structures. The settlement follows years of controversy around the leadership of specialised units, and this development is likely to prompt renewed calls for clarity from oversight bodies and from Parliament. Civil society organisations and political commentators will be watching the NPA stance closely as they demand stronger transparency in how taxpayer funds are used in sensitive prosecutions and employment disputes.

Next, a shift in trade and economic policy signalling a tougher tone in certain diplomatic relationships. News24 reports that an incoming deputy trade minister has publicly criticised relations with the United States while also raising concerns about the Transformation Fund. The deputy minister has signalled a recalibrated approach to trade diplomacy and a stricter scrutiny of mechanisms intended to drive economic transformation. Published details indicate the deputy minister will press for policies that align trade strategy with broader transformation objectives, and may revisit existing bilateral engagements. These remarks come as South Africa navigates complicated international trade relationships and seeks to ensure that domestic transformation goals remain central to economic policy. How this posture will affect trade negotiations or investment is uncertain, but the comments signal a more assertive tone from the Department of Trade.

Political watch now. A document reported by the Sunday Times and summarised by TimesLive reveals that the Democratic Alliance drew up a plan to bring Starlink, the satellite internet service associated with Elon Musk, into the South African market under a prospective DA led government. The submission is described as confidential and prepared before the election. It outlines a policy pathway for introducing private satellite broadband services to increase connectivity. The story has prompted debate about telecommunications policy, the role of private technology vendors in national infrastructure, and the political optics of aligning with a high profile international company. Supporters argue that new technologies could improve access in underserved areas; critics raise questions about regulatory oversight, national security and public control of critical communications infrastructure. The discussion highlights the tension between rapidly evolving technology options and established regulatory frameworks.

A developing mystery involving the South African Air Force has also drawn attention. News24 has reported on an air force aircraft operating near Mauritius under circumstances described as unclear. The report asks what the aircraft was looking for and notes that authorities have not provided a full explanation. The operation has prompted speculation and questions about regional cooperation, search and rescue activity, and the scope of South Africa military and humanitarian missions in the Indian Ocean region. Journalists have asked officials for comment and are seeking clarity on whether the flight formed part of a routine patrol, a search and rescue mission, or another operation that involved coordination with Mauritian authorities. Officials have so far given limited detail, and further information is expected as enquiries continue.

Finally, an item touching on legal oversight and high profile inquiries. Coverage in the Sunday Times and other outlets highlights controversy at the Nkabinde inquiry, where the National Director of Public Prosecutions took the step of refusing to answer questions until legal advice had been obtained. The move has sparked debate about accountability and the legacy of prosecutorial leadership. Commentators say the decision raises questions about how high profile inquiries are managed and how the NPA balances legal risk with openness. Observers note that it is early days in the inquiry process, but the episode has already fuelled discussion about institutional independence and the standards expected of top legal officials. The inquiry is likely to remain a focal point for oversight debates in the weeks ahead.

That is the main news for today. Thank you for listening.

That is all for today,
