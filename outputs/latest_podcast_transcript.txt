Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A I host, Leah. Today is thirteen January two thousand and twenty six. Here are the stories you need to know.

First up: matric results and what they reveal. Basic Education Minister Siviwe Gwarube has announced the National Senior Certificate results for the class of two thousand and twenty five. Nationally, the pass rate reached eighty eight percent, the highest on record. KwaZulu Natal stood out with a provincial pass rate of ninety point six percent, the top in the country. The Independent Examinations Board, the I E B, reported an overall pass rate of ninety eight point three one percent for its candidates.

Experts are cautioning against reading only the headline. Behind the high pass rate there are worrying trends that demand attention. Fewer learners are choosing to write mathematics rather than mathematics literacy, with only thirty four point one percent selecting mathematics in two thousand and twenty five. Performance in gateway subjects is mixed across provinces, and commentators say that steady pass rates can sometimes mask uneven quality of teaching, resource gaps, and persistent barriers to post school readiness.

Minister Gwarube used the release to praise teachers, learners and parents for their work and to celebrate top achievers, including differently abled learners who performed exceptionally well. As schools reopen this week, education officials say the focus must shift to consolidating gains, improving access to critical subjects, and strengthening placement and quality across provinces so that the pass rate translates into real opportunities for young people.

In environmental and disaster news: firefighting crews continue to battle extensive wildfires in the Franschhoek and surrounding Cape Winelands areas. Fireline estimates put the affected fire line at more than fifty kilometres, with crews working to contain multiple fronts. Coverage describes devastation across wine farms and rural properties, and local authorities and estate owners have been coordinating containment efforts.

Some reports say fires have been contained in certain areas, while others note that blazes remain active and that power outages are affecting residents. Firefighters, ground crews and volunteer teams have been praised for holding the line under difficult conditions. Emergency management teams are now moving into recovery mode, and damage assessments will determine the scale of loss to agricultural infrastructure and homes. This remains a developing story for communities in the Cape Winelands region.

Now a defence and diplomatic development involving South African waters. Iran has withdrawn from the multinational naval exercise Will for Peace, which was due to include South Africa, China, Russia and the United Arab Emirates. Reports say Iranian warships were in False Bay but would not take part in the exercise amid political tensions. Their decision means the South African hosted exercise will proceed without the Iranian vessels.

Organisers and commentators tracking the multinational exercise have publicly noted the absence of the Iranian ships. The episode has drawn attention to regional naval cooperation and the complexities of hosting multinational military events, especially where political sensitivities are involved. South African authorities and participating navies say they will continue with the exercise as planned, and observers will be watching how the event affects regional maritime cooperation and diplomatic relations.

In health sector news: Discovery Health reversed a controversial billing position after public uproar and regulatory scrutiny. A systems error produced notices telling sixteen thousand five hundred and seven members that they owed money, with some demands reportedly climbing into tens of thousands of rand. After pressure from the Council for Medical Schemes and public criticism, Discovery Health pledged to absorb the mistake and to issue refunds where appropriate, also promising to prevent disruption of benefits for affected members in two thousand and twenty six.

Coverage in national media framed the episode as a governance and controls question for a major medical scheme administrator. The regulator probe and public response appear to have spared members from financial harm, but the incident has prompted broader questions about oversight, systems resilience and accountability in private medical schemes. Policymakers and consumer advocates are calling for clearer safeguards so members do not face similar shocks in future.

Finally, a political development inside the MK Party. The party announced internal leadership changes, appointing Brian Molefe as its new treasurer general and removing Colleen Makhubele as parliamentary chief whip. Party officials said they relieved the former treasurer of duties with immediate effect and that the decision followed directives from national leadership. Colleen Makhubele will remain a member of parliament despite being relieved as chief whip.

The move continues a pattern of rapid personnel changes within the party and has drawn attention because Brian Molefe is a high profile public figure with a controversial career history. Political analysts say the reshuffle is likely to affect the partys internal dynamics and its approach to parliamentary business in the year ahead.

That is the round of stories for this morning: top matric results with underlying concerns about subject uptake and readiness for post school options; fierce fires in the Franschhoek and Cape Winelands area; Iran pulling out of the False Bay naval exercise hosted by South Africa; Discovery Health reversing a large billing error affecting over sixteen thousand members; and leadership changes inside the MK Party.

That is all for today,
