Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A I host, Leah. Today is Monday, tenth of November, two thousand and twenty five.

First up: a major investigative story that raises fresh questions about how public money has been claimed and spent. Daily Maverick reports an exclusive into the Collen Mashawana Foundation and what forensic experts describe as massive signatures fraud. The foundation, which featured in a previous Daily Maverick exposé that alleged misuse of project funds and irregular reporting, submitted documents to the Independent Development Trust to claim salaries for participants in a government funded employment scheme. Forensic analysis found thousands of signatures that experts say are likely forged. Workers listed in the documents say they did not receive their wages and some say they were made to perform work on private properties owned by the Mashawana family. The Independent Development Trust, now under new management, has said it will probe the allegations. Daily Maverick describes unpaid labour, duplicated or false signatures and claims amounting to millions of rand. This is a developing story and it highlights potential oversight failures in hiring and payment processes for state funded projects.

Next: another tender controversy linked to police contracts. News24 reports that Vusimusi Cat Matlala rented a medical clinic on South African Police Service property in Pretoria six months before being awarded a controversial health services tender worth three hundred and sixty million rand. Earlier News24 reporting alleged secret cash payments Matlala made to key police officials and that he employed a brigadier who evaluated the deal and then resigned. The Department of Public Works has opened an investigation into how Matlala secured the lease. News24s investigation says Matlala positioned himself ahead of the procurement process by securing the clinic lease well in advance of the tender advertisement. This again raises concerns about access, influence and the integrity of procurements linked to the police service.

In governance and public finance news: reporting across TimesLIVE and other outlets continues to scrutinise irregular procurement and state contract awards. TimesLIVE highlights how security firms were the biggest beneficiaries of irregular tenders at the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa to the tune of one point six billion rand. The investigation points to politically connected companies receiving large sums from contracts described as irregular. This story sits alongside broader coverage of procurement scandals in state entities and adds to mounting pressure for accountability after multiple reports of irregular tenders across several public agencies. The recurring theme in these pieces is the lack of transparency and the involvement of networks that appear to capture contracts and sidestep normal oversight, leaving taxpayers exposed and public services undermined.

Turning to the provinces: severe weather has once again hobbled parts of KwaZulu Natal. News24 reports that the provincial Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs department has deployed disaster response teams to Newcastle after a severe storm and flooding event wreaked havoc. Municipal engineers and technical teams are conducting inspections to assess damage, particularly where road surfaces and pavings have lifted. Local reporting describes flooding in the Newcastle central business district and power outages in affected areas. Authorities have warned of more heavy rain and urged residents to remain cautious as emergency services work to stabilise damaged infrastructure and restore basic services. Reports to date do not confirm significant casualties, and authorities continue to update communities as assessments proceed.

A brief note on public sector payouts: News24 also reports on a high profile settlement at the Public Investment Corporation. A former executive, the chief operating officer Vuyani Hako, reportedly received a settlement of ten million rand to leave the organisation after a period of suspension during which a forensic report alleged unexplained payments amounting to four point five million rand. The settlement reportedly included payment of short term and long term bonuses while he was suspended. Media coverage notes the forensic findings and the size of the settlement but does not establish that the four point five million rand in unexplained payments were directly offset by the ten million rand settlement. The arrangement has drawn criticism given the findings in the forensic report and comes at a time when trust in the management of state investment and pension funds is already fragile.

Finally, a word on the diplomatic spotlight around the upcoming G20 summit. Media reporting from Daily Maverick and other outlets details tensions after the United States declared it would send no official representative to the G20 meeting in South Africa, citing claims about persecution of a white minority. South African government spokespeople have publicly disputed those claims and described related material as disinformation. The diplomatic row is complicating summit preparations and has prompted local commentary on international interference and narrative battles in the run up to a major multilateral meeting on South African soil.

That is the Mzansi Lowdown for today. That is all for today,
