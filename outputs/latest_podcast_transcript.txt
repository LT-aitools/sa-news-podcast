First up, politics and a high profile resignation. Duduzile Zuma Sambudla has resigned as a Member of Parliament. The move follows allegations linked to the so called MK Russia matter, in which she is accused of duping party members into travelling to fight for Russia. The resignation was confirmed by party officials and has dominated coverage across several outlets today. The MK Party says the resignation is not an admission of guilt, and party spokespeople noted that Ms Zuma Sambudla declined to answer questions during a party briefing as reporters pressed for details. Reporting also draws attention to ongoing scrutiny around the fate of up to seventeen South Africans alleged to have been trafficked into the Ukraine conflict, and whether any criminal liability can be pursued in those cases. Legal experts and commentators are asking how investigations will be conducted, what evidence will be required, and which authorities have jurisdiction. We will continue to follow any official statements and developments as they come, and bring updates on formal charges or parliamentary processes when they are confirmed.

In law and accountability news the Madlanga Commission of Inquiry into political killings returned to the headlines this week. A senior police officer told the commission that the disbandment of the KwaZulu Natal Political Killings Task Team was irrational and calculated, testimony that has drawn sharp criticism of the decision to dismantle specialised units tackling political assassinations. The commission has been probing how docket management, resource allocation and alleged political interference may have affected investigations into politically motivated murders. Witnesses have described backlogs, gaps in evidence handling and the impact of personnel changes on ongoing probes. The inquiry is expected to deliver a report in the coming weeks, and panels convened to review suspicious authorisations are under the spotlight. The proceedings are a reminder of continuing concerns about the integrity of sensitive policing processes and the need for protections for investigators and whistleblowers. Civil society groups say any recommendations should include measures to strengthen forensic capacity and ensure continuity in cases involving political violence.

In crime news the latest quarterly statistics show murders in South Africa have decreased slightly year on year, but the toll remains alarmingly high. Between April and September this year the national average was sixty three murders per day. Police and criminal justice commentators welcomed the drop while warning that sixty three lives lost every day is unacceptable and that targeted interventions are still urgently required. Acting police leadership pointed to a notable decline in certain categories of violent crime, and officials said specialised programmes are beginning to make an impact in some areas, including hotspot policing, community policing forums and partnerships with local social services. Still, the scale of fatal violence underlines the ongoing challenge for law enforcement and community safety strategies nationwide. Analysts say sustainable reductions will require coordinated efforts on prevention, rapid case resolution and addressing root causes such as poverty, unemployment and access to firearms.

In economic and state enterprise news Eskom has reported a half year profit of twenty four billion rand. Headlines today note the utilitys profitability after a period of improved operational performance, but companies and analysts caution that risks remain. Reporting says the profit comes amid a period in which load shedding has virtually vanished, prompting debate about whether the gains are sustainable and what they mean for tariffs and the broader energy outlook. Concerns include Eskoms heavy debt burden, the need for ongoing maintenance, and investment in generation capacity to meet growing demand. Government, business and consumer groups will be watching closely as Eskom balances revenue, debt servicing and the operational demands of keeping the lights on for the country. Observers also say transparency around accounting and the sources of non operational income will matter for public confidence and tariff decisions.

Turning to health and public policy Deputy President Paul Mashatile will lead the official World AIDS Day commemoration in Limpopo on the first of December. The event comes as national campaigns push to maintain access to treatment and prevention services, and to close gaps in testing and care. In related health policy news plans have been reported to introduce pre exposure prophylaxis or PrEP in public hospitals next year. That move would expand access to an important HIV prevention tool through the public health system and could increase uptake for high risk groups if implementation and supply are secured. Health officials and civil society are urging sustained treatment access and outreach ahead of World AIDS Day, stressing that prevention, stigma reduction and continuity of care remain critical for progress. Local clinics and non governmental organisations are preparing targeted programmes to reach young people and key populations, with an emphasis on making services youth friendly and accessible.

A lighter local story to close today. A young cricketer from Benoni, Kearan Lee Weyers, is looking for support to advance his sporting career. The teenager has represented his school Hoërskool Hans Moore in the first team and competed at under eighteen interprovincial indoor and under seventeen Easter tournaments. With upcoming tournaments and tours on the horizon, funding is a barrier to his next steps. Supporters are being invited to donate so that he can play at national and international levels. It is one of those grassroots stories that shows how community backing can make a real difference to a young South Africans future and highlights the ongoing need for local sponsorship and development pathways in school sport.
