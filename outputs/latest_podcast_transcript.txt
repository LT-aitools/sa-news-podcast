Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your AI host, Leah. Today is three November two thousand and twenty five.

First up: a high profile criminal investigation is being started from scratch. More than two and a half years after Cloete and Thomas Murray were killed in a brazen shooting, police have handed the double murder investigation to a fresh detective team. The new unit is under the command of Gauteng top cop Major General Mbuso Khumalo. The Murray family has said they welcome the renewed focus, but their hope is tempered by thirty months of disappointment. So far, reporting establishes a new team, new leadership, and a family cautiously waiting for results as investigators reopen lines of inquiry and review earlier work on the case.

Next: Gauteng police have launched a manhunt following a deadly drive by shooting in Reiger Park, Boksburg. The incident left six people dead and three injured. National police commissioner Fannie Masemola has deployed a specialised team to hunt down the killers and has vowed to bolster policing in the area. Paramedics and emergency services described horrific scenes, and communities are reeling. Authorities say they are closing in on suspects, and national and provincial law enforcement resources have been mobilised as investigations continue. This is an active investigation and further updates are expected as police release more information.

In national governance news: former president Thabo Mbeki is calling for changes to how South Africa elects its president. Speaking at a National Dialogue event, Mr Mbeki said the way presidents in South Africa are elected is wrong and urged urgent reform to address the multiple crises facing the country. He said an inclusive dialogue is required to find structural fixes and warned that South Africa needs urgent intervention to steady its economy and its institutions. Coverage highlights his view that reforming the presidential selection process should form part of that national conversation.

Turning to local government and service delivery: Johannesburgs water crisis remains a major story. Residents from Thembelihle to Soweto are reporting prolonged outages that are disrupting schools, threatening public health and fuelling crime, according to on the ground reporting. Civil society groups are demanding urgent action and accountability from the City as frustrations deepen. Meanwhile, reporting has exposed that two contractor companies with limited track records continue to draw on a three year, two hundred and twenty three million rand water supply contract intended to keep taps flowing during outages. That situation has prompted questions about oversight and whether the contract is delivering value while many communities remain without reliable water.

In higher education and public institutions: the chairperson of the National Student Financial Aid Scheme board, Dr Karen Stander, has resigned with immediate effect. She cited a toxic work environment marked by racism, bullying, intimidation and threats to her familys safety as reasons for stepping down. NSFAS is a cornerstone of student support and her resignation raises fresh concerns about governance and culture at an institution central to access to tertiary education for thousands of students. Stakeholders are calling for a swift and transparent process to stabilise the board and to protect the integrity of student funding ahead of the new academic year.

In public interest reporting: a judge has handed a significant ruling on energy regulation. A high court found that the National Energy Regulator of South Africa process for approving municipal electricity tariff hikes is unconstitutional. The court has ordered Nersa to implement new timelines to allow proper public participation in future decisions. The finding is being touted as a victory for consumers and for procedural fairness, and it may influence how municipalities and regulators consult the public on future tariff decisions. Municipal councils and Nersa will now need to adjust their consultation processes to meet the court ordered requirements.

And finally, a governance and accountability piece out of the Eastern Cape: families in rural areas continue to face serious health risks from diagnostic failures. Reporting has shown the anguish of an Eastern Cape family whose young woman was wrongly treated for tuberculosis instead of cancer. Misdiagnosis between tuberculosis and cancers such as lymphoma remains a significant clinical challenge in rural parts of South Africa with high tuberculosis rates. The coverage highlights the human cost of diagnostic errors and calls for improved pathology services, faster referral systems and better training for clinicians working in resource constrained settings.

That is the rundown for today. We have focused on stories that directly affect people in the Republic, from renewed investigations into a double murder and a deadly drive by shooting, to calls for political reform, a worsening water crisis in Johannesburg, governance challenges at NSFAS, a landmark energy regulation ruling, and a troubling health story from the Eastern Cape. We have excluded stories that are purely international unless they directly involve South Africa.

That is all for today.
