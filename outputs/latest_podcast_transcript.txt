Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your AI host, Leah. Today is the nineteenth of December, two thousand and twenty five.

First up: a high profile murder investigation in Johannesburg. Police say three suspects may have approached Warrick Stock, also known as DJ Warras, when he was shot a few days ago. Authorities are probing the killing amid reports that Stock had recently applied for a protection order tied to a hijacked building. The investigation is ongoing and police are focusing on possible links between the protection order and the motive for the attack. Gauteng political leaders have reacted, urging better protection for people who seek legal remedies. The case has prompted calls from some quarters for stronger action against building hijackings and related criminality, and there are expected memorial events and further policing updates as the probe continues. Note that some details remain subject to police confirmation, and reporting continues as investigators release more information.

Next: diplomatic tensions after South Africa detained foreign nationals connected to a United States refugee programme, prompting a stern warning from Washington. The United States has threatened what it calls severe consequences following South Africas deportation of Kenyan nationals, and has accused South African authorities of harassing United States government staff engaged in humanitarian work. Pretoria rejects those claims. The Department of International Relations and Cooperation has begun diplomatic talks with both the United States and Kenya over arrests linked to the refugee scheme. South African officials say they are in discussions to clarify the circumstances. The row has escalated quickly and remains fluid as DIRCO engages with its counterparts to resolve outstanding issues. We will follow developments closely and report official statements as they are made available.

In education news: Gauteng faces a worsening school admissions crisis ahead of the start of the two thousand and twenty six academic year. Reports say more than ten thousand Grade One and Grade Eight learners remain unplaced amid persistent problems with the online admissions system. Parents and civil groups have expressed alarm and frustration, pointing to technical glitches, poor communication and unwanted transfers that have stretched confidence in the process. School governing bodies and education officials are under pressure to provide clear plans to accommodate learners in time for the first day of school in January. Calls are increasing for an urgent overhaul of admissions management, and political parties and civil organisations have demanded clearer plans and immediate fixes so that children are not left without schools when classes begin. Education authorities have said they are working to resolve cases and to prioritise placement for the most vulnerable learners.

Turning to the criminal justice system: legal experts have criticised the National Director of Public Prosecutions Shamila Batohi following her abrupt exit from the Nkabinde inquiry. Observers warn the walkout raises accountability questions and leaves parts of the investigation in doubt. Reports note that the sudden departure has stirred debate about the inquiry's future and whether it will affect efforts to resolve allegations connected to the matter under investigation. The development has drawn coverage across the legal and political media, with commentators calling for clarity on the reasons for the exit and on how the National Prosecuting Authority will proceed to ensure public confidence in the process. At the same time, stakeholders are urging transparency so that the inquiry can continue without unnecessary delay. Officials have said they will provide further information as the situation evolves.

Weather and public health updates now. The South African Weather Service is forecasting more rain on Christmas Day and into the New Year, and has issued warnings for several provinces. Authorities and meteorologists say a wet season pattern is likely to persist into late summer across much of the country, increasing risks of heavy downpours and localized flooding in vulnerable areas. Residents in low lying and flood prone communities are being urged to take precautions and to follow local emergency advice. At the same time, health authorities in the Western Cape and the National Institute for Communicable Diseases are urging parents to keep children up to date with measles vaccinations. The NICD has released its weekly measles and rubella situation report, while the Western Cape health department has renewed calls for immunisation as cases climb. Officials are stressing that vaccines are the most effective protection as the festive season places additional pressure on health services. Health facilities are advised to prepare for increased demand and to communicate clearly about vaccination sites and times.

A brief governance note: the Presidency has received the interim report from the Madlanga commission, which is probing allegations of criminality and political interference in the justice system.

Members of Parliament and civil society groups are calling for the Presidency and relevant departments to consider the commission's recommendations carefully and to act where necessary to strengthen independence and accountability across the justice system.

And finally, a public spending story: Cabinet minister Maropene Ramokgopa travelled to New York in an official capacity, with reporting indicating the journey cost nearly two million rand when accounting for expenses for both the minister and accompanying officials. The trip has generated questions in the media about travel expenditure and the use of public funds, prompting calls for transparency and scrutiny of official travel budgets. Public watchdog groups and opposition parties have asked for a detailed breakdown of costs and for clearer rules regarding travel approvals.
