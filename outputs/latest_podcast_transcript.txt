Howzit South Africa and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A I host Leah. Today is Sunday the thirtieth of November two thousand and twenty five.

First up a national security story that is still unfolding. Police tactical unit the Hawks have arrested four men in connection with an alleged recruitment network that aimed to send South Africans to fight for Russian forces in Ukraine. The arrests took place at OR Tambo international airport and the suspects are due to appear in the Kempton Park magistrates court. The matter has drawn wide attention after reports that a number of young South African men were targeted and allegedly misled into joining foreign military operations. The Presidency has responded publicly to the growing controversy and the fallout has already reached the national political stage. One lawmaker Duduzile Zuma Sambudla has resigned her seat in Parliament amid the wider debate over what is being referred to in the media as the MK Russia matter. Opposition parties are calling for a thorough independent inquiry into how recruitment was allegedly conducted and who may have been involved. We will follow developments as they move through the courts and Parliament.

Separately attention remains on the arrest of the leader of an IPHC church faction as well as fresh reporting on organised crime figures and who may be evading investigative scrutiny. Commentators in this weekends papers argue that politicians police and other powerful actors should be subject to the same investigative glare as ordinary citizens.

Science and health news researchers at the University of the Witwatersrand are developing an inhalable nanomedicine aimed at treating tuberculosis. The Wits project is working on a novel delivery method that could change how TB is treated offering targeted inhalation therapy as opposed to oral regimens. The initiative is noteworthy given South Africas long history in fighting tuberculosis and the ongoing need to improve treatment options.
