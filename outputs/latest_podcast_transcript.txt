First up, the G twenty Leaders Summit in Johannesburg — South Africa is centre stage this weekend as the first African presidency of the Group of Twenty unfolds amid high drama. President Cyril Ramaphosa opened the summit and said there is an overwhelming consensus behind the leaders declaration adopted at the meeting, despite diplomatic tensions with the United States. The United States initially signalled a boycott but then announced last minute participation at a diplomatic level, with Washington expected to send its charge d affaires, Marc D Dillard. The Presidency has made clear Mr Ramaphosa will not hand over the G twenty presidency to a junior official, and South African officials have formally told the United States they are displeased with the eleventh hour change.

Delegates adopted a G twenty Leaders Summit declaration in Johannesburg even as Argentina raised objections, and the South African sherpa team and presidency have been at pains to point to the consensus that delivered the final text. South Africa also used the platform to push African priorities. President Ramaphosa urged debt relief for the continent and called for a rules based global order. Ministers at the B twenty business forum pressed for measures that support trade and investment for Africa, and civil society representatives used the platform to call for greater market access for African small and medium enterprises.

The handover of the G twenty presidency to the United States is set to take place in the coming days, with officials saying the formal ceremony will be handled at the Department of International Relations and Cooperation, possibly as early as Monday. South African officials emphasise they will protect the dignity of the office and insist on proper protocol in the handover.

The summit has not been without friction on the streets. Outside the Nasrec venue there have been sustained protests, including clashes with Operation Dudula demonstrators. Police fired stun grenades and used tear gas at times, and at least two protesters were detained. National Joint Operational and Intelligence Structure officials said they recorded no security breaches inside the summit precinct, though police activity remained high as they managed crowd control. Meanwhile, Global Citizen NOW events and a high profile energy and climate agenda have run alongside the leaders talks, highlighting calls for clean cooking, off grid renewables and a greater push on energy access for the continent. Organisers said these parallel events are intended to keep leaders accountable to outcomes for developing countries.

In domestic political and social policy news, the government has declared gender based violence and femicide a national disaster. The declaration was announced amid widespread protests and pressure from campaigners who demanded gender based violence be prioritised on the G twenty agenda and across national policy. Civil society groups have welcomed the move but warned that a declaration alone is not sufficient. Organisations such as Rise Mzansi have urged that the national disaster status must be followed by concrete political will, strict accountability and real budgets tied to measurable outcomes. Newsrooms covering the story note that women led protests and initiatives at events in Johannesburg called for sustained action, not just symbolic recognition. Analysts say the declaration could unlock emergency funding and faster administrative processes, but only if implementation is monitored closely.

Weather warnings now: severe thunderstorms, blistering winds, heavy rain, hail and the risk of flooding are forecast across four provinces, with a Level five warning issued for parts of KwaZulu Natal. Authorities have named eThekwini, Ugu and uMgungundlovu among the areas expected to be hardest hit by torrential rain and flash flooding. Local municipalities and provincial emergency services have urged residents to stay indoors where possible, to prepare for potential flooding, and to heed safety instructions. The intense forecast comes at a time when large public events are underway in Johannesburg and when transport and emergency services are already stretched, so officials are emphasising preparedness and caution for communities in the affected regions. Residents are advised to secure loose items, know evacuation routes and to report rising water levels to emergency centres.

A troubling story affecting South Africans overseas: seventeen young men linked to a private military recruitment group are stranded in a combat zone in Ukraine and are begging the South African government to bring them home. Reports say these men could face severe legal consequences on return. The coverage signals a growing concern within South Africa about citizens becoming involved in foreign conflicts and the potential legal and diplomatic complications that follow. Government sources and analysts are watching how repatriation requests and any ensuing prosecutions will be handled in the weeks ahead. Legal experts say each case will need to be assessed individually, weighing criminal liability, immigration rules and diplomatic relations, while families press for urgent consular assistance.

Finally, a local service delivery crisis: Johannesburg waste challenge is deepening. The city is struggling with landfill capacity as three of six waste sites have reportedly reached maximum capacity and closed. The resulting backlog has worsened rubbish collection and added pressure on the city administration to integrate informal waste pickers and to find sustainable short and medium term solutions. Commentary in local papers notes that landfills are running out of space and the metropolitan council is running out of time, warning of health and environmental consequences if the situation is not addressed urgently. City officials say they are exploring temporary transfer stations, increased recycling initiatives and partnerships with private operators while calling on national government for support where required.

That is the main headlines for today.

That is all for today.
