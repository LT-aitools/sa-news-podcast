Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your AI host Leah. Today is the twenty third of December, two thousand and twenty five.

First up, a major development in a case that has shaken the local media community. Police have arrested two suspects in connection with the murder of media personality Warrick Stock, known to many as DJ Warras. The arrests follow an interrogation and an extended police probe into the fatal shooting in Johannesburg on the sixteenth of December. Authorities say the two will be charged and are expected to appear in the Johannesburg magistrates court in the middle of the week. Community reaction has been strong, and relatives and colleagues continue to mourn the loss of the popular DJ. News outlets report that further court steps will follow as the investigation proceeds and that the police are continuing to gather evidence and take statements from witnesses to build the criminal case.

In weather and disaster news, severe storms and flooding have left parts of the country reeling, with relief operations under way. At least two confirmed deaths have been linked to the recent severe weather, while search and rescue efforts continue in KwaZulu Natal and along the south coast. In Amanzimtoti authorities recovered two bodies and are still searching for a third person after a vehicle was swept away by floodwaters. Margate saw a tragic wall collapse that killed a woman and left several people missing. The KwaZulu Natal provincial government has described these floods as a setback to infrastructure repairs already in progress. Emergency teams are busy with clean up and providing immediate relief to affected communities as municipalities assess damage and prioritise assistance. Community organisations and nongovernmental groups are coordinating with provincial authorities to supply shelter, food and medical support to those displaced or affected by the storms.

Turning now to education, a new report warns that at least one hundred and sixty eight thousand pupils will have to walk long distances to school next year due to failures in scholar transport provision. News Twenty Four highlights how the scholar transport crisis is leaving vulnerable learners without reliable school transport, with families and children facing unsafe or impractical journeys. Gauteng education officials say online placement for Grade one and Grade eight learners has largely been completed, yet thousands remain unplaced and transport challenges persist across provinces. The implications are immediate for attendance, safety and schooling outcomes as the new academic year approaches. Education advocates are calling for emergency funding and better co ordination between provincial education departments and municipal transport services to ensure learners can get to school.

In community safety and law enforcement, calls are mounting for a stronger response in Bekkersdal after a deadly tavern attack that left nine people dead. Local residents and some political representatives are demanding intervention by the South African National Defence Force amid allegations of police complicity with illegal miners and broader criminal networks. Coverage notes that the motive for the killings remains unclear as police continue investigations, and families of victims are being sought for identification and case updates. The attack follows a string of violent incidents that have heightened fears in the township and intensified scrutiny of policing and community safety strategies. Community leaders are urging improved police visibility, faster forensic processing and sustained social crime prevention programmes to address the underlying drivers of violence.

A controversy in the Western Cape is drawing national attention. Bitou deputy mayor Nokuzola Kolwapi has denied discharging a firearm during her sons traditional umgidi initiation ceremony in KwaNokuthula, Plettenberg Bay. Viral video footage showed what appeared to be a person firing into the air at a traditional event. Kolwapi maintains that the object she held was a replica toy firearm and not a real weapon. The incident has prompted charges to be laid and an investigation to be opened, while political parties say they will wait for the outcome of the police probe before commenting further. The matter has sparked a wider debate about public conduct during traditional ceremonies and the responsibilities of public office bearers when attending or participating in cultural events.

A brief economics note from utilities and energy. Uptake of household scale solar registration with Eskom remains very low. News Twenty Four reports that only about one thousand five hundred customers have registered their solar systems with Eskom to date. That is a small fraction of households that have installed rooftop systems, and authorities are urging customers to comply with registration requirements. The limited registration is being watched by municipal planners and the national power utility as they manage grid stability and policy on distributed generation. Energy experts say better communication, simpler registration processes and clear guidelines on export limits could improve compliance and help protect the national grid.

Finally, a quick note on public health as the year closes. The National Institute for Communicable Diseases and provincial health departments continue to monitor vaccination and disease trends, reminding the public to take precautions over the festive season. Health services and community organisations are urging people to reach out if they are struggling emotionally over the holidays, with mental health organisations highlighting available support lines. Provincial departments have also reiterated guidance for safe festive gatherings and encouraged those eligible to check their local clinics for routine vaccinations and seasonal health advice.

That is the Mzansi Lowdown for today. That is all for today.
