First up allegations that South African men were recruited to fight in Russia and Ukraine. Multiple media outlets report that families and authorities are following disturbing claims that young men were lured to Russia under the promise of education or training and then sent into combat. One account describes a nineteen year old from Botswana and his twenty year old cousin who were told by a recruiter they would attend an educational programme. Their families have had no contact with them for three months and the pair are reported to have been deployed on a combat mission. News organisations have identified Duduzile Zuma Sambudla daughter of former president Jacob Zuma as a central figure in the recruitment allegations. She has been accused in reporting of organising or facilitating travel and training arrangements and according to some reporting she blamed another recruiter for some of the arrangements. The Hawks are reported to be investigating claims that seventeen men were manipulated to assist the Russian army. The matter has prompted commentary and calls for clarification from senior political sources. Families remain desperate for information and some now say sons are missing in the Donbas region. These are serious and evolving allegations and we will update this bulletin as further verified details emerge from police inquiries and independent reporting.

In legal news a Gauteng High Court judge has been arrested amid allegations of corruption. Media reports name the individual in relation to an alleged bribery scheme connected to proceedings over a succession dispute at the International Pentecost Holiness Church. Two men are reported to have been arrested alongside the judge and are accused of paying kickbacks. Authorities say the probe concerns decisions made in that high profile church case. At this stage these are allegations and the matter is subject to lawful processes. The arrests underline continued attention on corruption within both religious institutions and the judiciary. We will follow court updates and any official statements from judicial oversight bodies as they are published and report confirmed facts as they are released.

Now to parliamentary and prison business Vusimuzi Matlala widely known as Cat Matlala has asked for a postponement of his testimony before an ad hoc parliamentary committee. Matlala is in custody at Kgosi Mampuru C Max Prison in Pretoria and his lawyers argue that imprisonment and his current condition are affecting his ability to understand the charges and to prepare evidence. The committee has scheduled his appearance but Matlala sought a delay citing his mental state and lack of preparation time. Correctional services officials say heightened security measures have been put in place for his planned testimony. Parliament and the ad hoc committee will determine whether the hearing is postponed. Separately media reports indicate that despite an attempted postponement at least one news outlet expects Matlala to appear before the committee and legal teams are preparing arguments on both sides. We will monitor the hearing for any rulings on fitness to testify and for statements from prosecutors and defence representatives.

Turning to policing and public finance the South African Police Service chief financial officer has expressed shock after an internal note attributed to her was used to justify disbanding part of the Political Killings Task Team or PKTT. The matter has ignited a furious exchange at parliamentary hearings. Officials told an ad hoc committee that the PKTT has cost taxpayers four hundred thirty five million rand since two thousand eighteen. The police finance boss has argued that irregular expenditure has not been taken seriously and warned of systemic problems in financial oversight. Opposition members and committee participants have questioned the transparency of spending and the decision making that led to the PKTT review and partial disbandment. The debate comes at a time when South Africans are watching governance of security agencies closely. Parliament has indicated it will pursue clarity including whether internal notes and financial records were used appropriately and whether full accountability will follow.

A brief note on accountability in state entities Parliament is also pressing the former Road Accident Fund chief executive Collins Letsoalo to appear before the standing committee on public accounts after receiving another summons. Committees have warned of possible action if he continues to decline attendance. This follows a wider pattern of public hearings where former and current executives are being asked to explain financial and governance decisions. These hearings form part of ongoing oversight efforts to improve transparency at state entities and to address alleged mismanagement affecting public funds.
