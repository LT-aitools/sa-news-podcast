=== DA claims VAT scrap victory - Thu, 24 Apr 2025 14:30 (SAST) ===

China’s stellar space dayWritten while feeling relieved that Vat is scrapped!    
Heather Robertson: Good afternoon Charlie Lau, it’s Thursday, 24 April 2025. Last night was a crazy news night. The whole diary we planned at our 4pm newsdesk handover was hijacked by National Treasury announcing the reversal of the controversial VAT increase on its website at midnight!  Greg Nicolson: Thank goodness our Business Maverick editor, Neesa Moodley, was still awake to do a quick turnaround and get the story out. 
Heather Robertson: Now we have all the political parties falling over each other, claiming victory for stopping the VAT hike. Greg Nicolson: Yeah, such opportunism. This morning our political reporter, Tori O’Regan, was at the DA press conference in Cape Town explaining how the DA court case won the day, while Nonkululeko Njilo is still at the ANC and other parties’ press conference where they are claiming victory too.
 
Heather Robertson: I’m not sure any of them won. If they had just a thin slice of political maturity, the GNU parties should have worked together on the Budget and found alternatives to the VAT hike long before the drama and bickering.  
STORY OF THE DAY
DA claims win in Treasury VAT U-turn, says ANC ‘deception happens repeatedly’ in GNU
In a dramatic budget U-turn, Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana has scrapped the controversial 0.5% VAT hike just days before its 1 May implementation – which the DA is calling a major victory. Victoria O’Regan explains that the party credits its legal challenge for the reversal, which followed weeks of tension and a political standoff with the ANC.
