=== The Point of little progress - Wed, 16 Apr 2025 14:35 (SAST) ===

Pandemic preparedness pact agreedWednesday, 16 April 2025Written while juggling news-knives   Zukiswa Pikoli: Chris Makhaye’s series on the City of eThekwini is really mind-blowing – like can you believe it’s been plunged into R35-billion worth of debt because of fraud, corruption and inefficient billing?!
 Greg Nicolson: The decline in basic services is glaring, with residents going without water for weeks.
 Zukiswa Pikoli: Absolutely unacceptable. Why should people be brought to their knees like this for services that are guaranteed to them? 
Greg Nicolson: Seems like the only people benefiting are the corrupt. There might be a big shake-up in the 2026 municipal elections.STORY OF THE DAY

The Point of little progress: Ambitious plans meet reality amid corruption and crime
Once a crime-ridden wasteland, Durban’s Point Waterfront is now a sleek precinct with modern offices and beachside apartments. A revamped promenade, upgraded infrastructure and big-name tenants promised a R35-billion revival, but years later, many plans remain just that: promises.
Chris Makhaye reports that Covid, corruption, riots and service delivery failures have slowed progress, and while some buyers see an opportunity, others are cutting their losses. Residents are hopeful but sceptical.

🇸🇴 Al-Shabaab has attacked a town in central Somalia that the government was using as a staging area to drive back the militants. The group has made significant advances in the past month, leaving residents of the capital Mogadishu fearing a potential attack.PICTURE OF THE DAY
