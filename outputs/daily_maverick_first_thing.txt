 STORY OF THE DAY
Three police officers among Hennops River deadBy Lerato Mutsila The search for three missing police constables has come to a tragic end with the police confirming that they were among five bodies uncovered in the Hennops River in Centurion, Tshwane.WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING
🇸🇪👮 Three people were killed in a shooting in Uppsala, Sweden on Tuesday. The shooter is still on the run, and police are on the search. Gang-related violence and gun crime has been on the rise in the country.
🇧🇷🇿🇦 Not even the feathered gaggle of BRICS foreign ministers could agree on a joint statement on Tuesday after meeting in Brazil. With the Trump tariffs tsunami now heading straight into the bloc, consensus is quite an important thing to reach. BRICS members will have another attempt at cooperation in July.

🇺🇸🔊 Donald Trump’s 100-day Michigan rally saw him rattle out a list of what he called major economic wins. Trump, who is polling at historic lows after 100 days in office, told supporters: “We did great, and we’re doing better now.”
🇷🇺🪽 Vladimir Putin has named Volgograd airport as Stalingrad. The city had been renamed Volgograd in 1961, but with the return to the old ways, Putin has reiterated his delusion that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is similar to Stalin’s fight against the Nazis in WW 2.
