“Sentimentality is merely the bank holiday of cynicism.”Oscar Wilde 
April is for acorns, not newsletters
April was awash in public holidays. As a consequence you may have noticed most of our daily newsletters were amiss. Now safely ensconced in May, it might be worth mentioning to our newer readers that we try not to bombard you with newsletters on public holidays.That’s because we believe in both you and us taking a bit of a breather from daily news. Unless it’s massively important, in which case we’ll still be letting you know.Thus why, during Easter and on Freedom and May Day, your inbox could breathe a little lighter. We weren’t at our desks. I myself was off chasing my nearly-two-year old toddler around the park looking for acorns (“an-kors”  in his language), so I was hard at work anyway. Just the regenerative, happy type.
Many of our DM team were finding joy outside of work the past month, ranging from books to parks to spicy new series to watch. If you want to know what goes on inside DM, well you’d need to be an Insider of course. For those with the money to spare, you can always sign up here.

American students took part in a sperm-racing event that had a $1 million backing. Each competitor had their, ahem, "candidates", placed on a microscopic racetrack mimicking the reproductive system's chemical systems and fluid dynamics; Spanning 2mm, the race was presented to the audience as a 3D animation of the race. The winner was, and this is his real name, 20-year-old Tristan Milker; Milker milked out $10,000 in prize money.

=== Joshlin's Mother and Co-Accused Found Guilty - Fri, 02 May 2025 14:30 (SAST) ===

Russell Brand in courtWritten as we roll into May 2025.






Heather Robertson & Greg Nicolson






Greg Nicolson: Good afternoon Charlie Lau, it’s Friday, 2 May 2025. It’s hard to believe but more than a year after Joshlin Smith went missing, her mother Kelly Smith, her mother’s boyfriend Jacquen Appollis and their friend Steveno van Rhyn have been convicted of human trafficking the then six-year-old.
Heather Robertson: I’m still coming to terms with how deeply disturbing this has been. It feels as if justice has been served for Joshlin. This has really gripped South Africa.Greg Nicolson: Justice has partly been served. The accused never took the stand so there are still so many questions. Most importantly, where is Joshlin and what exactly happened to her?
Heather Robertson: The minimum sentence for human trafficking is life imprisonment. Smith, Appollis and Van Rhyn will have a lot of time to stew on the trial, and maybe one day they’ll give South Africa, and Joshlin’s family, the answers they’re looking for. STORY OF THE DAY
