=== Pastor Omotoso still in SA - Tue, 22 Apr 2025 14:30 (SAST) ===

Russia, Ukraine might be willing to talkWritten with a chocolate hangover.   
Zukiswa Pikoli: Good afternoon Charlie Lau, it’s Tuesday, 22 April 2025, I was hoping for a quiet news day for my shift on Easter Monday, when the pope died and silly MK SG Floyd Shivambu went off to Malawi to hang out with fraud- and rape-accused fugitive pastor Shepherd Bushiri at the weekend.
 
Greg Nicolson: The news cycle always spoils a good holiday. It’s looking like another busy week, with the VAT case in court and Zelensky on his way to SA. 
Zukiswa Pikoli: And today Estelle Ellis reports on another controversial pastor, Timothy Omotoso, the accused at the centre of a botched prosecution for sexually assaulting young women in his church. It turns out he was not deported hours after his acquittal, despite what the National Prosecuting Authority said. Greg Nicolson: Sadly, it’s no surprise that the NPA got it wrong on his deportation. The judge was scathing about the prosecuting authority’s failures in the case.STORY OF THE DAY

South Africa mourns death of Pope Francis, a unifying figure and a voice for the poor
By Kristin Engel The passing of 88-year-old Jorge Mario Bergoglio, Pope Francis, on Easter Monday has sent shockwaves of grief through South Africa’s Catholic community. Tributes continue to pour in from religious leaders, political parties and people across the country.WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING
🇷🇺🇺🇦 Russia’s Vladimir Putin has proposed direct peace talks with Ukraine for the first time since his three-day special military operation began in 2022. Volodymyr Zelensky did not respond directly, but did say in his nightly address that Ukraine was “ready for any conversation” about a ceasefire.
🇻🇦✝️ Doctors had told Pope Francis to rest for two months, but he kept working right until his death. The pope’s final Easter Sunday message repeated his call for a ceasefire in Gaza, labelling the war there as “deplorable”.
