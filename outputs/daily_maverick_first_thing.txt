=== Pastor Omotoso still in SA - Tue, 22 Apr 2025 14:30 (SAST) ===

Russia, Ukraine might be willing to talkWritten with a chocolate hangover.   
Zukiswa Pikoli: Good afternoon Charlie Lau, it’s Tuesday, 22 April 2025, I was hoping for a quiet news day for my shift on Easter Monday, when the pope died and silly MK SG Floyd Shivambu went off to Malawi to hang out with fraud- and rape-accused fugitive pastor Shepherd Bushiri at the weekend.
 
Greg Nicolson: The news cycle always spoils a good holiday. It’s looking like another busy week, with the VAT case in court and Zelensky on his way to SA. 
Zukiswa Pikoli: And today Estelle Ellis reports on another controversial pastor, Timothy Omotoso, the accused at the centre of a botched prosecution for sexually assaulting young women in his church. It turns out he was not deported hours after his acquittal, despite what the National Prosecuting Authority said. Greg Nicolson: Sadly, it’s no surprise that the NPA got it wrong on his deportation. The judge was scathing about the prosecuting authority’s failures in the case.STORY OF THE DAY
