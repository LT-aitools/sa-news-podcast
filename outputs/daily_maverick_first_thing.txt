🇯🇴🚓 Jordan has arrested 16 members of the Muslim Brotherhood, believed to have been planning an attack. The suspects were trained and funded in Lebanon, and had intended to use drones and rockets throughout the kingdom, authorities said.
🇺🇸🐶 A whistleblower complaint says that DOGE minions may have been responsible for a major “cybersecurity breach”, likely of sensitive case files. Logging protocols appear to have been breached at the National Labor Relations Board by the DOGE team of technologists.
🇺🇸💉 A measles outbreak in Texas has worsened, with at least 561 cases reported on Tuesday. The cancellation of an $11-billion package of grants to track and control infectious diseases was blamed by a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spokesperson for contributing to the unreported crisis now unfolding.

🇨🇦🎓 Canadian universities have reported a significant increase in applicants from the US. The University of British Columbia’s Vancouver campus noted a 27% increase in graduate applications compared to 2024. The US brain drain is evidently underway.

=== Police grilled in parliament over 'Cwecwe' case - Tue, 15 Apr 2025 14:55 (SAST) ===

China accuses US of cyberattacks on critical infrastructure 👾Tuesday, 15 April 2025

Greg Nicolson: Disgusted. Outraged. I’m not sure what else to say about our lead story from Caryn Dolley on the investigation into the alleged rape of the seven-year-old girl known as Cwecwe.


Zukiswa Pikoli: Those adjectives while apt, still don’t quite capture the horror that little Cwecwe has had to endure! Greg Nicolson: The police investigation seems to have hit a dead end, but we can’t ignore the crisis of abuse of children.

Zukiswa Pikoli: No we cannot, as pointed out in Parliament today, had it not been for mounting public pressure, who knows if the case would have gained the urgency it now seems to have?!STORY OF THE DAY

MPs also reiterated the broader problem of rape cases involving children. Caryn Dolly explains that no foreign DNA was found on the girl or her clothes and no suspect has been identified in a case that remains unsolved.
