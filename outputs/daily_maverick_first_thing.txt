=== Scrapping VAT hike by 1 May not feasible - Thu, 17 Apr 2025 14:48 (SAST) ===

SpaceX may win bid to build ‘Golden Dome’Written while dreaming of pickled fish, chocolate eggs and hot cross buns   Zukiswa Pikoli: Good afternoon Charlie Lau, it’s Thursday, 17 April 2025, and we know you are winding down for the Easter holiday, but we have some news before you log off. 
 Greg Nicolson: It’s looking increasingly likely that the VAT increase won’t be scrapped by 1 May. Will chocolate be zero-rated? Zukiswa Pikoli: VAT literally has us all on tenterhooks, especially chocolate lovers, I’m sure. Yeshiel Panchia and Lisakanya Venna’s article on TikTokers taking the mickey out of Donald Trump for his tariff war is actually quite a sobering take on the design industry, hey.
 Greg Nicolson: Yeah. It’s fascinating how Trump’s trade war is shifting perceptions on manufacturing and on how we define luxury. My luxury is time off for Easter. Happy holidays.
STORY OF THE DAYScrapping VAT hike by 1 May not practically feasible — Songezo Zibi
Despite mounting political pressure and public backlash, scrapping the proposed 0.5% VAT increase by 1 May is not realistically possible, says Rise Mzansi leader Songezo Zibi. With MPs on a two-week constituency period, the window to amend the fiscal framework has closed, at least for now.
Nonkululeko Njilo reports that Zibi believes alternatives can still be found within the year, claiming SARS could collect an extra R40-billion to offset the hike. But time is running out.

Over land and sea: 🇺🇸 Elon Musk’s SpaceX and two partners appear to be the frontrunners in a bid to build key parts of Trump’s “Golden Dome” missile defence shield. SpaceX is pitching a “subscription model” for missile defence, which will reportedly propose a satellite constellation of 400 to more than 1,000 defence satellites to protect the US. This sounds suspiciously like an action movie plot…
