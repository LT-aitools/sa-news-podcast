The Southern Africa Accountability Journalism Project has corroborated allegations of systemic corruption at the Eastern Cape Division of the High Court in Mthatha, where court officials solicit bribes from attorneys to perform routine administrative functions.WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING
🇺🇸⛓️ Donald Trump has ordered the reopening of Alcatraz to house “America’s most ruthless and violent offenders”. The federal prison was closed due to its enormous running costs, averaging three times the average due to its island location.
🇻🇦🇵🇸 One of the Popemobiles will be converted into a mobile health clinic for children in Gaza. The move is one of Pope Francis’s final wishes. Said the spokesperson of the project, “It’s not just a vehicle. It’s a message that the world has not forgotten about the children in Gaza.”

📽️⚡Marvel’s new movie Thunderbolts has raked in $162-million during its worldwide weekend debut. Although far short of the US and Canada $357.1-million opening of Avengers: Endgame in 2019, the weekend earnings are encouraging (for Hollywood at any rate).
🇺🇸📽️ ... which according to Trump, is not good enough. The administration on Sunday announced a 100% tariff on movies produced abroad that are then sent into the US, with Trump labelling incentives for foreign-produced films a “National Security threat”.
