Russia attacks Sumy’s civilians

“I find the great thing in this world is not so much where we stand, as in what direction we are moving.”
Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr STORY OF THE DAY
Political paralysis — SA’s best bet may be to muddle through the middle ground
By Stephen Grootes While our political classes have been seized with the ‘reset’ of the national coalition, a process that is supposed to result in electoral reform is under way, almost under the radar. There is a risk this could result in an almost binary choice — between enabling a political culture of winners and losers (as in the US) or a system that generates more power sharing, and thus political paralysis (as we have now).WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING
🇺🇦🇷🇺 President Volodymyr Zelensky has demanded a strong international response to Russia’s killing of 34 Ukrainians in Sumy on Sunday. Two ballistic missiles hit civilian areas of the city. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz  wrote in response, “These attacks show just what Russia’s supposed readiness for peace is worth.” 

🇵🇸🇮🇱 An Israeli missile strike has hit one of Gaza’s main hospitals. Israeli officials accused the hospital of being exploited by Hamas militants. The twin attacks effectively put the Al-Ahli Arab Hospital out of commission.
🇺🇸💊 Donald Trump underwent a routine physical examination, wherein the White House physician noted that his high cholesterol was being “well controlled”. Trump is taking two regular medications to keep things in check. He is the oldest president to assume office.
⛳🏆 Rory McIlroy secured his Masters title and a career grand slam after defeating Justin Rose in a sudden death playoff. Bryson DeChambeau started out in second place but dropped to 5th after a three over 75 ended his chances.
