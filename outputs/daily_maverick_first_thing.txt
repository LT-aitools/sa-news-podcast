“We see that some people do not want to have a child. Sometimes they have one, and that’s it, but they have dogs and cats that take the place of children. This may make people laugh but it is a reality.”Pope Francis 
VAT ’n kans || Zelensky || What’s in a pope?This week has been a flurry of activity. Much of which was quite important to us normal South Africans.
In case you live under a rock, our impending VAT increase was walked back. Announced in the dead of night, the cloaked news was superseded only by the crowing of every minor political party in South Africa’s (SA) existence. The collective shriek of communications minions by every party from Bosa to... *checks notes* the FF+ all claimed to have had a hand in forcing the ANC to bend the knee. In reality, it is likely a measure aimed at stabilising the existing GNU. The rest of us, however, are gatvol of the high school dramas and want to change channel.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky visited SA, prompting unprecedented levels of diplomatic interest in our country. As Ukraine reiterated its interest in a ceasefire deal, Zelensky had to rush back unexpectedly to Kyiv, following a massive Russian attack on the capital. As these talks unfold, it’s pretty clear that Moscow talks much, but shows little in terms of material action towards peace.
Today is Pope Francis’ funeral. For the Vatican, his legacy will be one of a comparatively liberal leader. And while his comments on replacing children with dogs and cats raise eyebrows, along with a string of sexist comments, Pope Francis was by and large loved by the Catholic world. 
What happens next? We don’t know too much, but the mysteries of the conclave is explained here (And also how they make sure the black smoke stays black to avoid confusion).

Do you feel like movies and TV shows these days have large tracts of barely audible mumbling? You’re not alone. A Vox survey found that a significant majority of readers felt exactly the same way.It’s relatively complicated, but a lot of it boils down to how much money filmmakers want to spend on re-recording actors’ lines. So, no, it has very little to do with your diminishing hearing ability and everything to do with budgets.

=== Zuma confident that arms deal charges will be dropped - Fri, 25 Apr 2025 14:45 (SAST) ===

Crowds fill the Vatican to mourn Pope FrancisWritten with great joy that it’s Friday and the sun is peeking through the Highveld clouds.

    
Heather Robertson: Good afternoon Charlie Lau, it’s Friday, 25 April 2025, the cold is back and with it load shedding, but many of us in Gauteng were not just load-shed but load-mugged. I haven’t had power in Tshwane East since 1pm yesterday, and some of our Joburg colleagues have been powerless for the last 38 hours. Have you got enough juice to get the news out on your laptop today Greg?
 
Greg Nicolson: I feel almost bad for saying it, but we haven’t been affected by power outages at all this week. Thankfully, because Naledi Sikhakhane filed an important update on Jacob Zuma’s arms deal case. The case has dragged on for so long that several witnesses have died, which could potentially lead to the charges being dropped. 
Heather Robertson: And Naledi was there when Oupa Mshiniwami was holding court saying, “We are taking back the country!” Why doesn’t the ex-President take a break rather? Play with his many kids and grandkids maybe. Greg Nicolson: It’s hard to take a break when you’re being persecuted by Cyril Ramaphosa, white minority capital and the biased judiciary – or so Zuma would have us believe. In fact, his Stalingrad strategy has helped him avoid accountability for decades. Heather Robertson: Ja-Nee, Jacob Zuma, Mzansi’s Houdini and Teflon Man all wrapped up in one.STORY OF THE DAY
‘We are taking back the country’ Zuma tells crowd, suggesting that his corruption charges should be dropped
Church Street in Pietermaritzburg was packed with chants and MK flags on Thursday, as former president Jacob Zuma’s bid to remove State prosecutor Billy Downer from his long-running Arms Deal case was denied. The court ruled that there’s no just cause to claim Downer’s involvement would lead to an unfair trial — a strategy Zuma has tried before.
Naledi Sikhakhane reports that outside the court, Zuma rallied supporters, claiming potential dismissal of charges and criticising the Government of National Unity’s recent VAT increase proposal.
