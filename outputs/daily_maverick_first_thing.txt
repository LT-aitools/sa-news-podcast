🇺🇸🏛️ Harvard University refused to accept a list of demands from Donald Trump on Monday and, within hours, had $2.3-billion in funding frozen. Harvard President Alan Garber wrote: “No government – regardless of which party is in power – should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue.”

🇸🇩💥 An estimated 400,000 people have been displaced from Zamzam camp in North Darfur, following an assault by Rapid Support Forces on Sunday. The RSF attack reportedly killed or wounded hundreds, including a large number of civilians.
🇺🇸⚖️ Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs has pleaded not guilty to an expanded indictment of several criminal counts including sex trafficking and racketeering. Opening statements in his trial are set to begin on 12 May.
🇬🇧🏗️ Britain has managed to secure enough fuel to keep its only standing steel blast furnaces operations burning. A race against time had been launched to secure coking coal and iron ore after a legal dispute had placed several shipments in jeopardy.
