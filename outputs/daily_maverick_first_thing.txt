 STORY OF THE DAYANC presses ‘Control-Alt-Delete’ on the national coalitionBy Stephen Grootes 

The decision by the ANC’s National Working Committee to ‘reset’ the national coalition opens the door to real change in the government. It can also lead to turmoil in the ANC.

🇺🇸📏 The White House has dismissed the burgeoning tiff between Elon Musk and Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro, declaring that “boys will be boys”. Musk referred to Navarro as “a moron” on his tariffs crusade, in a post on X. The most powerful office on the planet, dear readers...
🇺🇸⚖️ A judge has ordered the lifting of the Associated Press access restrictions at the White House. The news agency was banned by the Trump administration over its reference to the Gulf of Mexico (and not Gulf of America). The First Amendment, thankfully, still has some weight even under this presidency.

🇬🇧🎢 Universal Studios announced it will build its first European theme park in Bedford, near London. Opening in 2031, the park will include a 500-room hotel and, presumably, a metric ton of Harry Potter-themed rides.

⛳🌪️ The destruction of several pine trees at Augusta National Golf Club by Hurricane Helene in September 2024 has created some interesting new options for players. This year, a tree gap on the par-four 10th hole has opened up, making one of the hardest holes potentially less so. Things could get spicy at the Masters this week.
