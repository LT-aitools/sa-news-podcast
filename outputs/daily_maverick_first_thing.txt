🇺🇸💸 Less than a day after Donald Trump’s tariffs kicked in, the US President announced that he will temporarily lower the hefty duties for dozens of countries by suspending targeted tariffs for three months… except for China.

🇵🇦🚢 Panama said that the US has recognised its sovereignty over the Panama Canal. However, the development was noted in a joint statement in Spanish, but the English-language version released by the Pentagon omitted that line. 
🤝🇩🇪 After weeks of haggling, German conservatives under Friedrich Merz have clinched a coalition deal with the centre-left Social Democrats to spur economic growth. Chancellor-in-waiting Merz topped elections in February but fell well short of a majority.
