Penguins get tariff'dSaturday, 5 April 2025
“It’s now clear that the Donald Trump administration computed reciprocal tariffs without using tariff data. This is to economics what creationism is to biology, astrology is to astronomy, or RFK thought is to vaccine science. The Trump tariff policy makes little sense EVEN if you believe in protectionist mercantilist economics.”
Lawrence Summers Liberty Week 📉💸
In school, when the teacher had to leave class for a few minutes, there was always that one kid assigned to take down names of anyone talking or generally fooling about.This week our Parliament showed us in no uncertain terms who those kids grew up to be.
With the GNU crumbling before our eyes and a Budget likely to put more strain on our pockets, the opposition clingers-on who voted for the ANC’s budget will now have some fairly difficult questions to answer when nobody has more money in their pocket. Mr Maimane, Mr Zibi, we are looking at you now...Just as well global markets remained so stable, to buoy our unfolding domestic fiscal nightmare.
Taking centuries of economic policy and dumping it in the toilet, Donald Trump slapped hefty tariffs on everyone, with South Africa particularly hard-hit.
Most of our trade to the US comprises automotive-related items. For those working in the plants in the Eastern Cape and elsewhere, they will be contending with the double whammy of a VAT increase affecting virtually everything they buy and a market that no longer makes their product viable.
Many readers seem to think we “deserve” the Trump treatment. But anyone with a shred of empathy would temper that strongly with the knowledge that this week will be burning a hole in everyone’s bank account, in the worst possible ways.

The Krill tariff
Trump tariff’d everyone. Hard. But nobody was as hard-hit as, well, nobody. If that sentence makes no sense, it shouldn’t. Unless you work at the White House. Part of the Liberty Day package of tariffs included Heard and McDonald islands. Completely uninhabited, the islands are populated by penguins and seals. And since the seals won’t be paying the US tariff taxman, it’s up to the penguins.

Tariff turmoil: South Africa opts for diplomacy
Written ready for a sunny weekend.
Good afternoon Charlie Lau, it’s Friday, 4 April 2025, and not everyone is convinced by City of Cape Town’s “Invested in Hope” Budget, while Basic Education Minister Siviwe Gwarube came close, but no cigar, in her promise to eradicate pit toilets by the end of March. But first...
