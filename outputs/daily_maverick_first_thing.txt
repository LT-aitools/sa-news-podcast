=== Dali Mpfofu's hearing delayed - Wed, 30 Apr 2025 14:39 (SAST) ===

Switzerland bans HamasWritten working like mad a day before Workers’ Day

   
  Greg Nicolson: Good afternoon Charlie Lau, it’s Wednesday, 30 April 2025. No Workers’ Day for us tomorrow hey Heather, the news doesn’t take a break.  

Heather Robertson: Ja-but we need to sometimes hop off the news treadmill to think more deeply about stuff that’s right in front of our eyes. I’ve been thinking of digital nannies — about the impact of giving our kids mobile devices and gaming consoles to entertain themselves while we get on with our busy daily lives.
Greg Nicolson: I think it’s a short-term solution that leads to problems when you want to take the devices away. What’s made you think of this?
 
Heather Robertson: Mark Potterton, the principal of Sacred Heart Primary School in Joburg, spoke to me about a book that has got teachers and parents thinking — its called The Anxious Generation by author Jonathan Haidt. Apparently our kids who spend hours on devices instead of playing outside or just hanging out with each other experience much more social anxiety and depression. 
Greg Nicolson: I’ll have a read of the review that I see you’ve published on our website. Heather Robertson: Happy reading and Happy Workers’ Day. We will be working tomorrow, but this newsletter will be back on Friday.
