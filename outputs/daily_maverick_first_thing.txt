William Faulkner STORY OF THE DAY

WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING
🇮🇱🇵🇸 Israel has changed its tune on its murder of aid workers in Gaza last month. New footage emerged showing Israeli soldiers opening fire on the clearly marked aid vehicles, with lights on. The IDF is now seeking to find out how its initial take was so utterly wrong. 
⚖️💣 US Attorney General Pam Bondi has placed a Justice Department attorney on leave after he failed to defend the government’s handling of an individual deported erroneously. The victim, Abrego Garcia, was accused of being a gang member, despite zero pending charges.

📉💊 ... the first sign of which may be Asia’s markets, which utterly tanked on opening. Trump on Sunday had called his tariffs “medicine to fix something”, threatening that countries would have to pay “a lot of money” to have them lifted.
