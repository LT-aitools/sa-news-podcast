WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING
🇨🇦🗳️ Canada’s Liberals have kept hold of power, following historic elections on Monday. Final results are not yet available, but Prime Minister Mark Carney will almost certainly keep his position. 
🇵🇰🇮🇳 Pakistan’s defence minister warned on Monday that an Indian incursion is imminent. Tensions between the two nations have skyrocketed since a militant attack last week that left 26 people dead in Kashmir.
🇪🇸🇵🇹 Authorities were still trying to figure out what caused a widespread power outage across parts of Spain and Portugal on Monday. Planes, refineries and hospitals were all affected in the outage, while ordinary folks did what they do best: flock to the supermarket to buy toilet paper.

🇨🇳🇭🇰 In case anyone forgot, Hong Kong only just now started releasing pro-democracy lawmakers, four years after being jailed for “subversion”. China has mounted a massive crackdown against pro-democratic demonstrations since 2019.
