 Easter in Ukraine
Fun fact: while I spend my days writing newsletters for Daily Maverick, my brother Richard Stupart spends his time teaching media at the University of Liverpool. Sometimes, he goes to war zones. Last week, Richard was in Sumy, Ukraine, where the single deadliest attack this year by Russian forces was carried out. I’ve asked him to describe his experiences here.
“Every country hates its own brutalism as fascistic and loves some other country’s brutalism,” I’d joked to a colleague in the media department at Liverpool before my journey to visit the city of Sumy in Ukraine.
For the last six months or so, our department had been hosting academics and PhD students from Sumy State University as part of a twinning agreement between a number of UK and Ukrainian universities, and we’d on and off spoken about the possibility of a visit in the other direction.My flight to Warsaw in Poland on 10 April was an attempt to make good on that promise.
Visiting Ukraine in general, and Sumy in particular, is not a popular undertaking for scholars from the UK at the moment.It takes at best two days to make a journey from Warsaw (one of the closest open airports) to Sumy, via a combination of sleeper railcars built in an era where things were mostly made of steel.
Sumy is also located roughly 30km from the Ukrainian frontline with Russia, and suffers daily attacks by Iranian-manufactured shahed drones, which sound like lawnmowers over a cityscape that’s under an air raid warning for literally up to 20 hours in a day. Each carries up to 50kg of explosives and flies at up to 180km/h, enough to be an enormous threat to people in the city, whose universities, apartment blocks and factories they end up striking.
I’d decided to travel for a few reasons. One of the most obvious being simple curiosity to understand the place that colleagues from Ukraine were describing. More intellectually, I am a scholar of media, war and phenomenology. That means a lifelong professional interest in trying to understand how and why journalists in places like Sumy manage to do the work of reporting news to communities where having an accurate picture of the world is a very high-stakes matter.
Understanding these kinds of contexts isn’t possible through simply reading journal articles and trying to reason your way into them. They feel a certain way, and that feeling matters for getting to grips with what it means to be a journalist there. Finally, it matters in some more ephemeral way that a colleague from a safe city would choose to come to visit. It’s a gesture of normalcy and a willingness to put whatever skills one does have – in my case, the ability to think, write, and use a camera – to use. This is something American writer Susan Sontag understood well in her repeated visits to Sarajevo in the 1990s.

The morning of 13 April was the beginning of my first full day in Sumy. For the South African imagination, it’s about the size of East London, with comparable levels of municipal neglect due to the war. It has absolutely gorgeous orthodox cathedrals with minarets the colour of gold and sapphires under its blue spring sky, and the brutalist reminders of Soviet history everywhere.
The first explosion happened somewhere after 10am, when a ballistic missile landed in the city, about three blocks from my hotel. Unlike the slower shaheds, ballistic missiles leave the atmosphere and return at speeds that can reach up to 5-6 times the speed of sound: the impact is for all intents and purposes instantaneous.
The second, minutes later, was much larger, and I could feel the sound of it passing through the hotel. Like the experience of being near someone dropping an enormous bag of cement right next to you. Just much, much stronger. 
The area was immediately cordoned off by emergency services. A friend who works for the Sumy Red Cross spent the day in a sea of injuries. A trolley bus and those leaving a church service had been caught in the first blast, while the second – which detonated shrapnel in the air – was explicitly intended to kill those who ran to help the dying from the first attack. She had been fortunate to live close enough to run to assist, but not close enough to be murdered by a Russian missile for doing so.
“The objects that contain and deliver these kinds of forces are the ones that we keep locked away in bunkers, behind the Geneva conventions, because they have no place in a city on Palm Sunday morning”
A colleague who’d attended the scene that day said they’d never seen so many broken and detached limbs in their life. It was a scene of impossible cruelty.
The next morning, as cleanup efforts began in earnest, I accompanied the Red Cross to take photographs to document the scene. Glass covered the street like a sea of diamonds from the hundreds of windows that had shattered in the blast. It was difficult to comprehend the physics that could do such damage to buildings. A force that reached into every office, every classroom, and had just absolutely shaken it up like some kind of snowglobe. 
I cannot imagine what it would have been like to be a person in these spaces and to have survived. The door of the office of Tetyana Mayboroda, who’d helped organise my safe travel to Sumy, opened into thin air – three stories of the university building beyond it had been disintegrated in the second explosion.
A building is meant to be a solid thing – unable to move or deform or break in the kinds of ways these had. And certainly not do so in an instant. My diary from the day carries the reflection that the force that did this feels like a part of the world of physics I’ve never come remotely close to experiencing. Because in truth most of us haven’t.

A toothsome tale 🦷
If, like me, your teeth are in terrible shape, scientists at King’s College London and Imperial College London are now one step closer to creating lab-grown teeth. Long story short, but with a few more steps in the right direction, patients – or newsletter writers – can have new teeth grown with their own cells, making integration and repair in the jaw a lot simpler.
