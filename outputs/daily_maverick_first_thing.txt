Business Maverick is here for youSaturday, 12 April 2025“Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed, citizens can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has.”Margaret Mead Strictly Business
In case you missed it, this week has been entirely dominated by Trump's tariff tirade. Either a masterstroke long-term strategy by the genius MAGA administration, or, as virtually any sane economist has said, a complete and utter catastrophe.We have a (mostly new) Business Maverick team who will be covering this from every angle.
Moving forward with a new vision, they are very excited about bringing the boardroom into your living room, breaking down business into actions you can take and showing you how it affects your world.The Business Maverick team
Neesa – Business Maverick editor and writer of the Money Cents newsletter. 
Ed - the patriarch and legend. He is our go-to guy for mining, climate watch, animal rights and macroeconomics.   
Lindsey - crypto reporter, responsible for putting together the Crypto Corner newsletter. Also writes on tech, motoring and engineering.
Yeshiel - our investigative secret weapon who will be covering SOEs, government and uncovering corruption in the public and private sectors. He is also interested in AI, dabbles in coding and has a photography background. 
Lisakanya - our junior reporter working at all hours of the morning and night on the BM newsletter and After the Bell, as well as covering health and education.
Kara – who turned down three other job offers to take her place at BM – will be tackling financial services and the retail sector.Former Business Maverick editor, Tim Cohen, remains part of the team contributing After the Bell columns as an editor-at-large. 
We are a small and somewhat younger team but we’re feisty, enthusiastic and absolutely committed to our vision for the business section of Daily Maverick. 
Yes. We have a newsletter for Business.

Rather Dire-some

The advent of dire wolves was met with so much excitement that, for a little while at least, we did not question whether the resurrection of genetic dire wolves was accurate or not. Well, pack away the Valyrian steel broadsword, because the new pups are, unfortunately, not quite the real deal. They will look and feel like what a dire wolf should be, but it's almost as if Colossal were making more of a buzz before their IPO rather than genetically-fiddling. Ed Stoddard has a look at the facts.

=== Budget bust-up forces ANC to rethink GNU rules - Fri, 11 Apr 2025 14:30 (SAST) ===

Resurrecting the dire wolf 🐺
Written by Sarah Hoek. From now on, you’ll see some new names writing your newsletter. We’re excited for some fresh takes, with the same commitment to bringing you the best daily news right to your inbox.Friday, 11 April 2025Greg Nicolson: I suppose we should start by introducing ourselves? I’m a news editor at DM, so I spend most of my time chasing journalists who miss deadlines.

Zukiswa Pikoli: Yes, I think that's probably the most courteous thing to do. I’m Zukiswa, Managing Editor at DM. Also, why does this feel so nerve-wracking?!


Greg Nicolson: Very stressful! I have a newfound respect for the newsletters team. Speaking of “new”, Ed Stoddard’s article on dire wolves is fascinating. I’m ashamed to admit that I’d previously only heard of dire wolves in Game of Thrones. Sounds like these “resurrected” dire wolves might also be fiction.
Zukiswa Pikoli: Well now our collective shame has been revealed (haha), but also this dire wolf: how does something extinct come back to life? I know it’s Easter and all, but…
Greg Nicolson: They’re also looking at reviving the Tasmanian Tiger, which, as an Australian, I’m all for. But maybe we should be channelling resources into habitat protection in this era of mass extinction caused by climate change.
Zukiswa Pikoli: While we’re in the spirit of revival of animals and habitats, maybe we should also bring back the Quagga, and I don’t mean the rugby player… But back to our canine friend — apparently, the scientists  “extracted and sequenced ancient DNA from two dire wolf fossils”, which I found fascinating.

Greg Nicolson: Check out Ed’s story for more, and have a great weekend.
STORY OF THE DAY
Budget bust-up forces ANC to rethink GNU rules, Zille says forget it
The ANC is pushing for a formal, rules-based agreement to stabilise the coalition government and avoid future fallouts. Nonkululeko Njilo and Victoria O’Regan  report as negotiations between parties are set to continue over the weekend.

 WHILE YOU WERE WORKING
At home: 🇿🇦 It seems like the glue holding our GNU still has some stickiness. Minister of Home Affairs Leon Schreiber told News24 he will stick with GNU “until someone drags me kicking and screaming”, while PA leader Gayton McKenzie said he hates the DA but wants them to stay in the coalition because he “loves SA more”. While Deputy President Paul Mashatile told an audience at a Chris Hani commemoration that the DA might be like “a crocodile” but the GNU would not collapse.
Never mind the penguins of uninhabited islands in Antarctica being lumped withTrump tariffs, the Civil Aviation Authority found a penguin in a box was thecause of a helicopter crash on Bird Island in the Eastern Cape on 19 January, after the box slid off a passenger’s lap on takeoff and hit the pilot’s controls. 
Over land and sea: 🇨🇳 China retaliated against US tariffs with a levy of 125% on US goods being imported to the country, and US assets have taken a nosedive.🇦🇺 An Australian woman has given birth to a stranger’s baby after a fertility doctor accidentally implanted the wrong embryo. Adding to my list of fears.
