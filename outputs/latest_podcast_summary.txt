Next, we have some concerning developments in the fight against crime. Police Minister Senzo Mchunu has delivered the latest crime statistics, and they paint a mixed picture. While overall crime figures show welcome declines, there are still concerning aspects. Notably, one province in South Africa is experiencing a rise in murders. The Minister also addressed former US President Donald Trump's claims of a "white genocide" in South Africa, stating that, according to the statistics, the majority of farm murder victims are black.

In a related matter, there's a significant shake-up happening in Gauteng. Top Gauteng officials are facing potential consequences following a lifestyle audit. The audit’s findings are described as explosive. This could lead to several department heads being axed as the province aims to tackle corruption. Premier Lesufi is also cracking down on corrupt officials, building hijackers and corrupt official kingpins.
