Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Sunday, the twenty-first of September, two thousand and twenty-five. Let's get right into it.

Our top story today comes from Ekurhuleni, where land valued at thirty million rand was reportedly expropriated for zero rand. This decision has sparked significant debate, with the municipality stating that the primary goal is to provide housing for the impoverished.

Next, we shift our focus to the political arena. President Cyril Ramaphosa faces significant pressure. Reports from TimesLIVE indicate that he is in a "departure lounge," amidst controversy stemming from his endorsement of the Democratic Alliance or DA. This has led to a public relations drive to mitigate the damage. Several articles detail disagreements among ANC councillors.

In Johannesburg, the DA has announced Helen Zille as their candidate for mayor. Daily Maverick reports this announcement. Zille is positioning herself as a "daughter of Johannesburg," a shift in her public image. A recent poll suggests the DA is leading the ANC in Johannesburg.

Let's examine some of the details, as per the Sunday Times. The Sunday Times leads with a report about collaboration between Eskom, along with ministers from basic education and energy, to install solar panels at special needs schools. This initiative comes after a Sunday Times investigation revealed that schools for the deaf and blind had been facing crippling and erratic bills.

The Sunday Times has an exclusive where a new initiative is being launched by Google, pledging to back Wits University with one million dollars (which is the approximate value of eighteen million, eight hundred thousand, three hundred and seventy-five rand) to place Africa on the AI map.

Also featured in the Sunday Times is an article detailing the alleged mismanagement of Umngeni Water, the water service provider. It is alleged that directors have been helping themselves to fees worth millions of rand, with a law firm which has family links to the chairman scoring handsomely.

Another article from the Sunday Times focuses on the ongoing water cuts, which are hitting Carletonville Hospital, with stakeholders warning that the ongoing water cuts will compromise patient care, also infection control.
