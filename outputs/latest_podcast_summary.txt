Leah: Sawubona South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I'm your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Monday, the 7th of April, 2025, and we've got a packed agenda to get through. Let’s dive right in.

First up, we’re looking at the growing tensions within the coalition government. **Transition music**

Leah: Cracks are deepening, folks. The ANC is really lashing out at the DA over some recent missteps. President Ramaphosa is pushing back against pressure from the business sector, showing just how fragile this partnership has become. The ANC's chief whip has even called for consequences for the DA, signaling a real shift in the power dynamics. This could mean some significant changes are coming to how the government operates, and perhaps even a complete shake-up in the future. We will keep you updated on this, as we gather more information.

Leah: In other news, we have an update on that terrible case of the missing child, Joshlin Smith. The search has, unfortunately, turned into a social media circus, with inaccurate information being spread, and the work of the police being hampered. It’s really important to remember that behind every news story, there are real people, and real pain. Remember to approach stories like this with sensitivity.

**Transition music**

Leah: Moving on to something a bit different, a story of infrastructure and power. Public Works and Infrastructure Minister Dean Macpherson is calling for lifestyle audits into the bosses of the Independent Development Trust, or IDT. He’s also provided an update on the delayed oxygen plant probe. This is an investigation into an R836 million deal and seems to be facing several roadblocks. Macpherson says the investigation should be concluded by May. We’ll continue to watch this story, as it unfolds.

Leah: And now, a quick heads-up: authorities have opened a fifth sluice gate at the Vaal Dam due to the incredibly high water levels. This is a major cause for concern, and the rising water levels have prompted urgent warnings for communities in low-lying areas. Authorities are urging people to evacuate because of the risk of overflowing riverbanks. This means we have a situation that could cause some serious damage. We will be monitoring the situation for you and bring you the latest updates.

**Transition music**

Leah: Finally, let’s turn to the story of South African medical research, which is a real point of pride for us. South Africa has world-class medical researchers, but the sudden and severe US cuts to grants from the world’s largest health research funder threaten to unravel that landscape. It raises a very important question: will the government turn this crisis into an opportunity to give a helping hand? It's a crucial time for us in the scientific community, and we'll be watching closely to see how the government responds.

**Transition music**

Leah: That's all for today's Mzansi Lowdown. Thanks for tuning in. We’ll be back tomorrow with the latest updates.

**Leah:** Sawubona South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I'm your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Monday, the 7th of April, 2025, and we've got a packed schedule for you. Let's dive right in!

**Transition music**

**Leah:** Our top story today concerns the ongoing tensions within the coalition government. The ANC is hardening its stance against the DA, with cracks appearing in the partnership. According to Ferial Haffajee from Daily Maverick, the ANC is lashing out at the DA over recent missteps. This comes as President Ramaphosa pushes back against pressure from the business sector. The article suggests a growing divide, raising questions about the stability and future of the government of national unity. Keep an eye on this one, folks, it's a developing story.

**Leah:** Moving on, there's trouble brewing in the health sector. A News24 article reports that a 'friend' of the Gauteng health MEC has landed a two point five million rand T-shirt tender. This has immediately raised eyebrows. The story highlights concerns about potential cadre deployment and questionable procurement processes. The details are still emerging, but this has all the hallmarks of something that needs to be investigated thoroughly.

**Transition music**

**Leah:** Now, let's turn our attention to some serious environmental concerns. TimesLIVE is reporting that a building company has been suspended due to 'large structural defects' at an upmarket Hartbeespoort estate. The article details the suspension, shedding light on potential issues of construction standards and the safety of residents. We'll have to wait and see what further investigation uncovers, but clearly there are concerns about how this estate was built.

**Leah:** And in other news, the South African Reserve Bank is tightening its rules on what it deems “inappropriate” cross-border banking. This is according to a TimesLIVE article. This move could impact how financial transactions are handled and possibly aims to enhance financial stability and prevent illicit financial flows. This is significant for the banking sector, and the implications are certainly worth watching closely.

**Transition music**

**Leah:** Finally, let's highlight a story that brings us a mix of both good and bad news. A major car brand will be closing dealerships across South Africa. The news comes from several sources, including Business Tech and MyBroadband, and they state that the brand will be closing more than sixty percent of its dealerships here. While the impact this will have on the employees and local businesses remains to be seen, this is the reality of a changing automotive market.

**Leah:** Before we go, a quick reminder that authorities have opened a fifth sluice gate at the Vaal Dam due to surging water levels. Urgent warnings have been issued for residents of low-lying areas around the Vaal River, urging them to evacuate. Please take note of the warnings, and stay safe, South Africa.

**Outro music**

**Leah:** That's your Mzansi Lowdown for today. Thank you for tuning in. Until tomorrow, sala kakuhle!
