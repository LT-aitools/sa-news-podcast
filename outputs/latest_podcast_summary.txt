Our top story today focuses on the National Housing Finance Corporation, or NHFC.

This comes as a long-standing dispute between Eskom and the City of Johannesburg over unpaid electricity bills has reignited. Eskom is threatening to resume load shedding due to the non-payment of arrears by the city, putting further strain on residents and businesses.

Now, to matters of health, the South African Department of Health is on high alert. Health officials are urging vigilance against malaria, with cases on the rise. This is due to an increase in cases in neighbouring countries and the upcoming Easter holiday travel period. The public is advised to take precautions, including using insect repellent and seeking medical advice if they experience malaria symptoms.
