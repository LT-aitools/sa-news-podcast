Our top story today concerns the ongoing efforts to shut down the Skukuza Regional Court in Kruger National Park. A magistrate has once again been ordered to back off these attempts. This court has achieved remarkable success in prosecuting rhino poachers, and the reasons behind the repeated efforts to curtail its operations remain unclear.

In a separate development, South Africa is gearing up to tackle the issue of malnutrition in the Western Cape. The provincial government is launching a "targeted" nutrition scheme for pregnant women and mothers. The pilot program will be rolled out in Worcester, Khayelitsha, and Mitchells Plain, and aims to address the “shocking” stunting stats, ensuring better health outcomes for both mothers and babies.

Next up, we have an update on South Africa's relationship with the United States. The country has been ranked seventh in Kearney’s Emerging Markets 2025 FDI Confidence Index, marking a significant climb from eleventh place in 2024. This indicates that global executives are increasingly confident in South Africa's potential. However, a recent study indicates potential negative consequences. US funding cuts could lead to over one hundred fifty thousand additional HIV infections in South Africa by the year 2028, according to a new study.

In other news, South African MPs have been criticised for a "fact-finding mission" to Israel. The mission, which has been described as one-sided, found no evidence of apartheid. This controversial trip has sparked significant debate given the ongoing conflict and political climate.

Finally, a major decision has been made in the Premier Soccer League. Royal AM has been expelled from the PSL by the board of governors. This expulsion follows an outstanding tax bill of forty million rand, leading to the team being placed under curatorship by SARS.

And now for a few quick hits:

*   There's a new controversy as the Tshwane mayor has been accused of taking credit for work done by the previous administration.
*   A proposed thirteen point nine percent increase in water and sanitation tariffs for the 2025/2026 financial year in Joburg has sparked backlash.

That's all for today's Mzansi Lowdown.
