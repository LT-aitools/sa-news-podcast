Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Tuesday, the tenth of June, 2025. Let us jump straight into the headlines.

Our top story today is the political landscape in Johannesburg. Helen Zille, the former leader of the Democratic Alliance, is considering a run for Mayor of Johannesburg. This follows the decline of the DA's initial choices for the position. Zille has stated she will do anything to save the city, and there is a lot of discussion about her potential "fix-it plan," including what changes she might put in place if she gets elected. Other political figures, such as the current mayor, Morero, have dismissed the possibility of Zille's contention for the mayoral position.

Moving on, a major investigation into "ghost employees" in the public sector is underway. Investigations are uncovering a deliberate and orchestrated form of corruption. This is not just an administrative error, but rather a deliberate organized crime, according to a parliamentary committee. These ghost employees, or phantom workers, are drawing fraudulent salaries, diverting much-needed funds from the state. The government is promising a crackdown, and it will be interesting to see what changes come about.
