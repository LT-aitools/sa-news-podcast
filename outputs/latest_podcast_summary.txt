Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Friday, August 8th, 2025.

Let's dive right into the headlines.

Our top story today involves the Independent Development Trust, or IDT. Minister of Public Works and Infrastructure, Dean Macpherson, has laid criminal charges against the suspended IDT Chief Executive Officer, Tebogo Malaka, and spokesperson Phasha Makgolane. This action follows a recent exposé by Daily Maverick, which revealed an alleged attempt to bribe an investigative journalist, Pieter-Louis Myburgh, in order to suppress a corruption investigation. Minister Macpherson has vowed to "win the war" against corruption, showcasing the seriousness of the situation.

In other news, President Cyril Ramaphosa and former U.S. President Donald Trump held a telephonic conversation. The discussion centered on bilateral trade matters, occurring as new tariffs on South African goods come into effect. These tariffs, which come to thirty percent, have been put into effect by Trump. Minister in the Presidency, Khumbudzo Ntshavheni, has suggested that there is still potential to reach a trade agreement between the United States and South Africa, signaling a willingness to engage and find common ground.

Turning to the ongoing challenges in the energy sector, Eskom faces more scrutiny. Both the Black Business Council and Business Leadership South Africa have criticized Eskom for challenging the trading licenses of independent electricity traders. This move by Eskom is seen by many as a reactionary strike against reform and could further entrench the power utility’s monopoly. With these challenges, there is increasing pressure for Eskom to withdraw its legal actions.

A significant development involves the ANC's strategic moves within the Government of National Unity, or GNU. The ANC is considering inviting ActionSA and the National Council of Provinces to join the GNU in an attempt to reduce the influence of the Democratic Alliance, or DA. This could lead to a shift in the political landscape and reconfigure the power dynamics. With the ANC seeking to bolster its position, this move underscores the ongoing negotiations and realignments within the current government.

Lastly, we have some important updates regarding South Africa's water resources. The Department of Water and Sanitation reports that despite recent rains, levels in many of the country’s largest dams remain below average, highlighting the persisting drought conditions. These are difficult times, and the government urges vigilance and conservation efforts. The Western Cape, however, is showing a more positive picture. Dam levels in the Western Cape average around seventy-nine percent.
