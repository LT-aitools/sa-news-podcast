**Leah:** Sawubona South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I'm your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Monday, the 7th of April, 2025, and we've got a packed schedule for you. Let's dive right in!

**Leah:** Our top story today concerns the ongoing tensions within the coalition government. The ANC is hardening its stance against the DA, with cracks appearing in the partnership. According to Ferial Haffajee from Daily Maverick, the ANC is lashing out at the DA over recent missteps. This comes as President Ramaphosa pushes back against pressure from the business sector. The article suggests a growing divide, raising questions about the stability and future of the government of national unity. Keep an eye on this one, folks, it's a developing story.

**Leah:** Moving on, there's trouble brewing in the health sector. A News24 article reports that a 'friend' of the Gauteng health MEC has landed a two point five million rand T-shirt tender. This has immediately raised eyebrows. The story highlights concerns about potential cadre deployment and questionable procurement processes. The details are still emerging, but this has all the hallmarks of something that needs to be investigated thoroughly.

**Leah:** Now, let's turn our attention to some serious environmental concerns. TimesLIVE is reporting that a building company has been suspended due to 'large structural defects' at an upmarket Hartbeespoort estate. The article details the suspension, shedding light on potential issues of construction standards and the safety of residents. We'll have to wait and see what further investigation uncovers, but clearly there are concerns about how this estate was built.

**Leah:** And in other news, the South African Reserve Bank is tightening its rules on what it deems “inappropriate” cross-border banking. This is according to a TimesLIVE article. This move could impact how financial transactions are handled and possibly aims to enhance financial stability and prevent illicit financial flows. This is significant for the banking sector, and the implications are certainly worth watching closely.

**Leah:** Finally, let's highlight a story that brings us a mix of both good and bad news. A major car brand will be closing dealerships across South Africa. The news comes from several sources, including Business Tech and MyBroadband, and they state that the brand will be closing more than sixty percent of its dealerships here. While the impact this will have on the employees and local businesses remains to be seen, this is the reality of a changing automotive market.

**Leah:** Before we go, a quick reminder that authorities have opened a fifth sluice gate at the Vaal Dam due to surging water levels. Urgent warnings have been issued for residents of low-lying areas around the Vaal River, urging them to evacuate. Please take note of the warnings, and stay safe, South Africa.
