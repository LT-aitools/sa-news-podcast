Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Thursday, June fifth, 2025. Let's get right into it.

Our top story today concerns the ongoing foot-and-mouth disease outbreak, which is causing significant disruption in the red meat industry. The disease has hit several areas, including Gauteng, with major beef producers like Karan Beef suspending cattle intake. The Department of Agriculture, Land Reform, and Rural Development is implementing an animal transport crackdown to control the spread. A seventy-two million rand foot-and-mouth vaccine delivery is expected in mid-June to help with the crisis.

The High Court found that the extradition of former Free State government official, Moroadi Cholota, from the US was unlawful. This case involves alleged asbestos corruption. The ongoing failure by the NPA’s leadership may stymie efforts to appeal the ruling.
