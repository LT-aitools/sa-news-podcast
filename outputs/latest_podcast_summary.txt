**Leah:** Sawubona South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I'm your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Thursday, the 10th of April, 2025, and here's your daily briefing.

First up, we have a developing story concerning the Government of National Unity, or GNU, and a recent trip to Israel.

**Story 1: GNU Tensions Over Israel Trip**

DA and Patriotic Alliance MPs reportedly went on a "fact-finding" trip to Israel. This has already caused some friction, with other parties in the GNU demanding answers. The implications of this trip are that it could deepen political tensions within the coalition. We'll be keeping a close eye on this.

**Story 2: George Building Collapse Probe**

Turning to a story from earlier in the week, the investigation into the tragic George building collapse continues to reveal serious shortcomings. The probe into the collapse of the five-story residential development, which resulted in the deaths of thirty-four people, has uncovered deficiencies within the National Home Builders Registration Council. These issues include flawed inspection processes, underqualified staff, and a failure to enforce safety standards on-site. The report emphasizes the need for stricter regulations and oversight to prevent similar disasters in the future.

**Story 3: VAT Hike and the EFF’s Legal Challenge**

Shifting gears, let’s delve into the political arena and the ongoing debate surrounding the recent VAT increase. The Economic Freedom Fighters, or EFF, has taken the fight against the VAT hike to the courts. They are challenging the adoption of the fiscal framework and the powers of the finance minister under the VAT Act. The EFF is arguing that the increase is a violation of rights, and are asking the court to scrutinise the process. The party has stated the VAT hike will come into effect on May the first, regardless of any agreements with government. The DA is also involved in the legal challenge, making this a very unusual alliance.

**Story 4: Trump's Tariff U-Turn and SA's Economic Outlook**

Now let’s turn to an issue with global ramifications, but also a potential impact on South Africa: Donald Trump's sudden change in tariff policy.

Earlier this week, Donald Trump paused tariffs for most countries, while raising them for China. While this decision has caused significant volatility in global markets, South Africa may be relatively spared from the worst of the fallout.
The South African rand, however, remains under pressure amid the ongoing global trade war and domestic concerns. It has touched its worst levels ever against the US dollar, raising concerns about inflation.
The rand has been trading at around nineteen rand to the dollar, which could push up the prices of imported goods.
