Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Thursday, the fourteenth of August, two thousand and twenty-five. Let's get right into the headlines.

Our top story today involves a diplomatic situation. Ministers have castigated the Chief of the South African National Defence Force, or SANDF, over remarks he made expressing solidarity with Iran. This follows the SANDF chief's recent visit to Iran, where he made statements of support. This has caused a stir within government, with both the Ministries of International Relations and Cooperation and of Defence distancing themselves from his comments. The situation has led to discussions about the SANDF's role in foreign policy and the importance of aligning statements with the government's official stance.

Next, we turn to a developing story from Maponya Mall in Soweto. Chaos erupted yesterday, leading to a deadly incident. Reports indicate one person was killed and two others were injured in an attack involving e-hailing vehicles. Details are still emerging, but the incident is being investigated by authorities, and the MEC has condemned the violence. This situation highlights the ongoing challenges faced by e-hailing drivers and the need for enhanced safety measures in the area.

In other news, the automotive industry is facing significant challenges. Since two thousand and twenty-three, the sector has seen twelve closures and the loss of four thousand jobs, according to the Minister of Trade, Industry and Competition. The minister also mentioned that the government is considering major changes to auto subsidies. This comes amid warnings from industry leaders about an "existential crisis" in the South African automotive landscape. There is hope, however, with the Minister's plans for renewal and a way forward for the industry.

Now, let's move on to a legal matter. The murder trial of AKA, also known as Kiernan Forbes, and his friend Tibz has been set down for July of two thousand and twenty-six. A judge scolded lawyers in the case yesterday, indicating the need for a more efficient handling of the pre-trial process. This case, which involves the high-profile murders of AKA and Tebello Motsoane, continues to capture the public's attention.

Finally, another developing story that has been the focus of our attention, is the response from South Africa’s Department of International Relations and Cooperation, or DIRCO, regarding the U.S. State Department’s recent human rights report. DIRCO has rejected the report, calling it "inaccurate and deeply flawed." The report from the U.S. raised concerns about the human rights situation in South Africa, prompting a strong rebuttal from the South African government. The U.S. report is said to contain criticism of South Africa, adding to already strained relations between the two countries.
