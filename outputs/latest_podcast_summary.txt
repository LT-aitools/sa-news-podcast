Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Sunday, the third of August, two thousand and twenty-five. Let's get straight into the headlines.

Our top story today focuses on the impact of potential United States tariffs on South Africa. A recent News24 article indicates that a phone call from President Cyril Ramaphosa may be the government's last chance to avert serious economic damage. The tariffs, if implemented, could have devastating consequences, with one South African company already reporting losses of seven hundred and fifty million rand in deals overnight. Cosatu, the Congress of South African Trade Unions, has warned that these tariffs will lead to significant job losses, creating a "jobs bloodbath." The Democratic Alliance has also weighed in, pointing out that economic turmoil is a real threat. This situation highlights the critical need for a resolution and the urgency of President Ramaphosa's intervention.

Next up, we shift to a serious development in Johannesburg. Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana has issued a stern ultimatum to Johannesburg Mayor Dada Morero. The warning comes in response to the city's ongoing financial troubles. The minister has demanded that Mayor Morero take immediate action within two weeks to address the city's financial chaos. Failure to comply could result in cuts to Johannesburg's funding. This situation underscores the severe financial challenges facing some of South Africa’s largest municipalities and the government's determination to enforce fiscal responsibility.

In another significant story, we turn to the realm of politics. Solly Mapaila, from News24, has spoken out against what he perceives as the African National Congress, or ANC's, betrayal of the left. He has criticized the ANC, saying that they are denying people the right to contest. This follows several recent internal political decisions. This situation is generating considerable discussion about the direction of South African politics and the relationships within the ruling party.
