Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Tuesday, the fifteenth of July, two thousand and twenty-five. Let us jump right in.

Our top story today involves a significant court ruling. A judge has ordered Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, to unmask a user who posted explicit, sexual content depicting South African schoolchildren. The judge has also issued a ban on the channels where this content was shared. This decision underscores the growing concern over online child exploitation and the legal responsibility of social media platforms to protect vulnerable users.

Next up, we have developments surrounding the South African Police Service, SAPS. President Cyril Ramaphosa has announced the establishment of a Commission of Inquiry. This inquiry will investigate allegations of capture within law enforcement agencies. This follows a series of articles and podcasts from News24, Daily Maverick and other outlets detailing the issues facing the police force. This inquiry aims to restore public trust in the SAPS and address issues of corruption and misconduct. Acting Police Minister Firoz Cachalia will reportedly use an unreleased anti-corruption report to address failures within the police and intelligence services.

In other news, the ongoing saga surrounding the appointment of an acting police minister continues to make headlines. Ramaphosa called Firoz Cachalia an hour before appointing him as acting police minister. Many have also criticised the appointment, with the EFF and MKP taking issue with it and questioning the process. The appointment comes after Mchunu was benched, with the constitution taking centre stage as the debate continues.

This development may offer some relief to households struggling with the rising cost of living. The Department of Agriculture has also warned of a new outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in the Free State, which is also worth noting.

Also, on a completely different note, there are increasing concerns over the state of the JSE, with various factors contributing to a shrinking market. This is something that has an effect on investments.
