Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Tuesday, the sixteenth of September, 2025.

Let's dive straight into the headlines.

Ramaphosa also noted that there is a need to not protect individuals implicated in corruption.
