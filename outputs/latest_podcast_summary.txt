Leah: Sawubona South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I'm your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Tuesday, April 15th, 2025, and here's your news update.

First up, let's talk about the ongoing Government of National Unity, or GNU, situation. The Daily Maverick is reporting on three potential scenarios for South Africa's future, depending on how the current political landscape unfolds. The central issue? The proposed VAT increase. A court challenge to the VAT hike is still pending. Simultaneously, there's speculation that the Treasury may drop the increase altogether. This pivotal decision will significantly influence the direction of the GNU and, by extension, the lives of all South Africans. The three scenarios Daily Maverick is examining will affect everything from economic stability to social welfare.

Next, we have a significant appointment. President Cyril Ramaphosa has appointed Mcebisi Jonas as a special envoy to the United States. This comes as Pretoria seeks a permanent replacement for former US envoy Ebrahim Rasool, who was expelled from the US in March. Jonas, who previously served as Deputy Finance Minister from two thousand fourteen to two thousand seventeen, was also one of Ramaphosa’s investment envoys appointed in two thousand eighteen. This appointment underscores the importance of South Africa's relationship with the United States, particularly as the country navigates complex international trade and political dynamics.

Now, moving onto a serious matter: an investigation into the death of Chief Albert Luthuli. Reports from IOL and Daily Maverick indicate that a new inquest is probing whether the Nobel laureate was murdered by apartheid agents. The NPA alleges a cover-up, with evidence suggesting collusion between security police, district surgeons, pathologists, prosecutors, and magistrates. This re-opening of the inquiry aims to uncover the truth surrounding Luthuli's death and bring justice to those responsible for his demise. The family is also prepared to open the wounds in the quest for truth.

Next, another pressing issue, the Gauteng Department of Education has cut ties with Nal’iBali. This decision comes after allegations of child sexual assault involving a Grade 3 learner and a Nal’iBali practitioner. Nal'iBali is a reading-for-enjoyment campaign. This move by the department underscores the importance of child safety and the seriousness with which the government treats allegations of this nature.

Finally, a story on the financial front. The investigative news outlet amaBhungane has reported that the IDT, the Independent Development Trust, paid a company belonging to CEO Tebogo Malaka’s family member more than thirty-three million rand. The payments were mainly for projects related to school construction. This has sparked concerns about potential conflicts of interest and financial mismanagement within the IDT.
