Our top story today: The ANC is facing a major hurdle in its coalition government, with a budget bust-up causing them to rethink the rules of the Government of National Unity, or GNU. Sources are indicating that the ANC is now pushing for a formal, rules-based agreement to avoid future fallouts. The DA is pushing back, with their leader, Zille, reportedly saying "forget it" to any changes that would lessen the party's influence. This follows disagreements regarding a proposed VAT increase. The ANC is now also poised to drop a proposed zero point five percent VAT hike.

Next, we turn to a story that’s causing some serious concern: US funding cuts for HIV programs are a major worry for South Africa. The Daily Sun reports that there are fears of how these funding cuts from the United States could negatively impact the fight against HIV in Mzansi. A new study suggests that the cuts could lead to over one hundred and fifty thousand additional HIV infections in South Africa by the year two thousand and twenty-eight. This is a significant blow to the country's efforts in combating the HIV epidemic.

In other news, the Sunday Times reports on a US think-tank warning of broad sanctions against South Africa. The Hudson Institute, a conservative think-tank, suggests that South Africa's stance on issues, including its relationship with Israel, could lead to exclusion from the SWIFT payment system.
This could have serious implications for South Africa’s financial transactions.
