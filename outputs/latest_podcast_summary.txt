Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Sunday, the tenth of August, two thousand and twenty-five. Let's dive into the top stories of the day.

First up, we have the ongoing saga surrounding the national dialogue. Reports indicate a significant clash between President Cyril Ramaphosa and former President Thabo Mbeki. This disagreement has seemingly caused a ripple effect, leading to several key groups withdrawing from the National Convention. Several foundations have expressed that the government is rushing the process. This withdrawal raises concerns about the credibility of the dialogue, with some stakeholders feeling the process is moving too quickly, and potentially, without proper consultation.
