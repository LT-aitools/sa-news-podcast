Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Friday, the 25th of July, 2025. Let's get straight to the headlines.

First up, a developing story that continues to dominate the news cycle: the controversy surrounding Kenny Kunene.

Kunene, the current Joburg transport MMC, remains in office, even as the mayor of Johannesburg is reportedly still getting briefings on the situation. Reports indicate that the Patriotic Alliance, the party to which Kunene belongs, wants to replace Kunene with one of their own councillors. However, only Mayor Dada Morero has the official power to remove Kunene.

Moving on to the ongoing turmoil within the South African Police Service, or SAPS. An Ad Hoc Committee is set to probe the claims made by Lieutenant General Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi. A commission established to investigate these allegations will also have the power to refer cases for immediate criminal investigation. This development comes amidst a broader discussion about the leadership within the SAPS, with some sources suggesting that the Hawks are not up to the task of addressing internal corruption.

Now, let's turn our attention to international relations, specifically the relationship between South Africa and the United States. President Cyril Ramaphosa has responded to the US push for sanctions against South Africa, and it looks like it could get worse. The US House of Representatives’ Foreign Affairs Committee has passed an anti-South Africa Bill, with a US congressman claiming South Africa has sided with communists and terrorists.

Another story gaining traction relates to state capture and corruption. The former Chief Justice, Raymond Zondo, has voiced strong criticism, specifically that South Africa’s system gives party bosses too much power to control MPs. This critique of the system follows on from reports about the work of the Unburdening Panel and its efforts to bring to light instances of state capture.
