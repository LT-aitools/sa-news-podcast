Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I'm your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Thursday, May 1st, 2025, and here’s what's making headlines:

Our top story today concerns the ongoing saga surrounding former Public Protector, Dali Mpofu's disciplinary hearing before the Legal Practice Council. The hearing, held on Wednesday, April 30th, 2025, was delayed. The power outage disrupted proceedings, along with changes to the charge sheet. The charges relate to his conduct during cross-examination in the parliamentary inquiry into former Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane's fitness to hold office.

Moving on, a concerning report from a recent study indicates that the number of HIV-related deaths in South Africa may be far higher than previously estimated. The study, conducted by the South African Medical Research Council (SAMRC), highlights the need for further investigation into the factors contributing to these discrepancies, and to improve the accuracy of the data.

Lastly, a new inquiry is underway, ordered by President Ramaphosa, to review claims of past failures to prosecute apartheid-era crimes. The inquiry will investigate alleged suppression of justice in the killings and other injustices of the apartheid era. The goal is to understand why so few prosecutions occurred, and whether government actions hindered the pursuit of justice.
