Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Thursday, June nineteenth, two thousand and twenty-five, and here is what’s making headlines:

First up, we have political developments focusing on key figures within the political landscape. Floyd Shivambu’s media briefing is making waves, but reports clarify that it was not affiliated with the uMkhonto we Sizwe Party, or MK Party. There is speculation surrounding his political future, with some sources suggesting a potential resignation from the MK party. Former President Jacob Zuma is also in the news, criticizing past actions of former secretaries-general.

Moving on, let's delve into a story concerning the economy and potential corruption. The news reveals that a tenderpreneur, or someone involved in getting tenders, was part of the recent France-South Africa business trip alongside Deputy President Paul Mashatile. This raises questions regarding access to those in power without sufficient accountability, and highlights the role of political connections in certain business dealings.

Now, let's discuss developments surrounding the higher education sector. Minister Nobuhle Nkabane has released the names of panellists who oversaw controversial appointments to the boards of Sector Education and Training Authorities, or SETAs. These appointments are now facing scrutiny and it is believed that the DA has referred Minister Nkabane to the ethics committee for allegedly misleading Parliament. The Higher Education Committee is also considering criminal charges over the Seta panel.

Next, a significant story related to the investigation into the murder of the musician AKA and his friend, Tibz. The murder trial of the accused is facing some complications, with the defence potentially exploring a "Cholota strategy" to avoid a trial. The trial itself has now been postponed to July twenty-fourth.
