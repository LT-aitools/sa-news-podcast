Moving on to a story with political and economic implications: the South African government is defending a policy change that will allow Elon Musk's Starlink to operate in the country. IOL reports that the Department of International Relations and Cooperation, or DIRCO, is calling this in the national interest. However, there are many diverse opinions on this subject. Some are applauding the move as a way to improve internet access in South Africa, whilst others are concerned about potential competition with current providers. Reuters also reports that astronomers are worried about Starlink's impact on observations made by mega-telescopes. Icasa, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa, is investigating the alleged illegal use of Starlink, and the Financial Times reports that South Africa faces a backlash over the plan to change the law for Muskâ€™s Starlink.
