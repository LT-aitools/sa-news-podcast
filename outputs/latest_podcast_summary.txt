Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Sunday, the twenty-second of June, two thousand and twenty-five, and these are your top stories.

Our top story today is on the escalating tensions overseas and their possible implications. While the focus is on international relations, it is important to note the potential impact on South Africa. U.S. forces have reportedly struck Iran's key nuclear sites, according to President Donald Trump, who warned of further attacks if a peace agreement is not reached. This conflict has global implications, potentially affecting trade, security, and international relations, which South Africa closely monitors.

Next, we turn to politics. Minister Nobuhle Nkabaneâ€™s woes are deepening. The Sunday Times is reporting on the Higher Education Minister's troubles with the South African Education and Training Authority, SETA. Reports detail claims of alleged corruption and a possible cover-up, adding pressure on Minister Nkabane. This comes after a formal complaint was lodged with the South African Human Rights Commission, or SAHRC, regarding the violation of pupils' constitutional rights.

Moving on, we discuss the political landscape. A recent News24 article reveals that the African National Congress, or ANC, has regained election-level support, while the Economic Freedom Fighters, or EFF, have experienced a significant decline in backing. This shift in voter sentiment could dramatically reshape the South African political scene, influencing upcoming policy decisions and the strategies of various political parties.

Our next story covers the issue of child welfare. The Sunday Times details "The Anguished Plight of SA's Invisible Children". Hundreds of thousands of children in South Africa are denied essential services. These children, lacking birth certificates, face barriers to healthcare, education, and social welfare, highlighting a critical challenge in protecting the country's most vulnerable citizens.

Finally, we have an update on financial matters. The Daily Maverick delves into the ongoing battle over the national lottery license. Two losing bidders are demanding answers from the Minister of Trade, Industry, and Competition, Parks Tau. This comes as another losing bidder has lodged a review application in court. This is a continuing saga of legal challenges surrounding the national lottery.
