Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I'm your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Friday, the 2nd of May, 2025, and here's what's making headlines.

Our top story today concerns South Africa's teachers. A concerning report indicates that approximately half of the country's educators are considering leaving the profession. The reasons cited include overwhelming workloads, safety concerns within schools, and a perceived lack of support from the system. This potential exodus poses a serious threat to the education sector, potentially worsening the already existing challenges.

Next, we turn to a tragic discovery. Police have recovered the car belonging to three deceased SAPS officers from the Hennops River in Centurion. The vehicle was retrieved on Wednesday following the discovery of five bodies, including the three constables. While the investigation is ongoing, early indications point towards a possible traffic accident. The details surrounding the deaths are still under scrutiny, but the incident underscores the dangers faced by law enforcement officials.

In other news, the National Student Financial Aid Scheme, or NSFAS, is facing increasing scrutiny. Reports indicate that NSFAS has failed to make timely accommodation payments, leaving landlords burdened by unpaid bills. Consequently, some landlords are evicting students, leaving them stranded, particularly during their critical exam periods. This situation highlights the ongoing challenges within the student funding system and the impact it has on vulnerable students' access to education.

We now turn to a disturbing investigation into the state of animal welfare at some government-funded poultry farms. The NSPCA, or National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, has revealed shocking conditions at Daybreak chicken broiler farms, including cannibalism and mass starvation. Thousands of birds have either died or been euthanized due to a lack of food. This grim situation raises serious questions about the management and oversight of these farms, as well as the ethical treatment of animals.

Finally, the Joshlin Smith kidnapping trial is reaching a critical juncture. The defence is arguing that the state has failed to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. The fate of the accused will be decided today as the court is set to deliver its judgement. If found guilty, the accused face potential life sentences. This case, involving the disappearance of the young girl, has garnered significant public attention and is a crucial moment for justice in South Africa.
