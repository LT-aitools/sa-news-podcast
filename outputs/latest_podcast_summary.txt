Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Saturday, August thirtieth, twenty twenty-five. Let's jump right into the headlines.

First up, we have a story from News24 regarding the Mangaung Metro. The report details how the bankrupt metro paid prices inflated by as much as one thousand five hundred percent to suppliers connected to the African National Congress. This comes at a time when the city's finances are in dire straits, highlighting concerns of corruption and mismanagement.

Next, we turn to a developing story about the Gauteng's political killings task team. The Minister of Police, Mr. Cachalia, has slammed the top cop after one hundred and twenty-one police dockets were returned to the task team. IOL is reporting that there is concern over the return of these dockets and the implication of possible political interference. This all comes before the Madlanga Commission, which is set to investigate the issue.

Our third story focuses on the Ekurhuleni taxi strike. This strike has left thousands of commuters stranded. TimesLIVE reports that Santaco, the South African National Taxi Council, is currently meeting with the transport department in an attempt to resolve the situation. The SABC News and eNCA also report that taxi drivers have halted operations in the area, leaving commuters in difficult situations. Residents are now facing major disruptions in their daily commutes.

Moving on, we have a report on the latest electricity tariff hike. The South African Federation of Trade Unions, or SAFTU, says that the latest electricity tariff hike will push millions of South Africans into poverty. EWN has the story and further reports on Nersa's settlement, which sparks fear of higher bills. The report also indicates that the consumers are on the hook for Nersa's fifty-four billion rand tariff blunder.

Lastly, we pay tribute to the late Tshidi Madia, a respected journalist and editor at EWN. Her siblings have said that she treated their children like her own. Madia's passing has left a void in the field of journalism. Multiple sources are reporting on her loss, including Daily Maverick, News24, and the City of Ekurhuleni. The Inkatha Freedom Party, or IFP, has also released a statement, recognizing Madia's contributions.
