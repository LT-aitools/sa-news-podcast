Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I'm your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Thursday, May 22nd, 2025. Let's get right into it.

Our top story today concerns serious allegations of corruption at the Mthatha High Court in the Eastern Cape.

The Southern Africa Accountability Journalism Project has corroborated claims that court officials are soliciting bribes from attorneys to perform routine administrative tasks. This means that lawyers are reportedly being forced to pay extra money just to get basic things done.

Next up, we're looking at the fallout from the budget.

Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana delivered the Budget 3.0 speech yesterday, marking the third attempt to table the fiscal plan. The VAT increase, which had been a point of contention, has been withdrawn. The budget prioritizes infrastructure and social welfare. For every one hundred rand spent, around thirteen rand goes to basic education, and twelve rand to social protection. However, cuts have been made to funding for education and health, and there’s an increase in the fuel levy. The new budget also includes an additional tax measures worth twenty billion rand, scheduled for the 2026 budget, unless the South African Revenue Service manages to collect more revenue. The budget has been described as a balancing act between controlling debt and investing in social programs, but a budget that is not necessarily a solution, but a temporary fix.

In other news, there is a worrying story emerging from Gqeberha.

Two premature babies were abducted from the Dora Nginza Hospital. Both babies were still in incubators, leading to serious concerns for their well-being. The Eastern Cape Department of Health confirmed the abduction on Wednesday morning, May 21, 2025. The babies were found later on Wednesday, and were safely returned to the police. This incident raises serious questions about the safety measures in place at the hospital.

Another story that has caught our attention is the ongoing water crisis in Knysna.

The crisis is being compounded by political infighting and an attack on a Gift of the Givers water truck. Repairs to damaged infrastructure are underway, but the situation is far from resolved. Residents and businesses are feeling the impact.
