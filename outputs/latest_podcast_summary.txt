Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I'm your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Saturday, the 26th of April, 2025. Let's get straight into the headlines.

First up, the VAT hike saga continues.

The Democratic Alliance, or DA, is still in the GNU, also known as the Government of National Unity, after a meeting with the African National Congress, or ANC, on Friday. The DA has expressed its commitment to the partnership. However, the DA has had to file a supplementary affidavit to the Western Cape High Court to stop the VAT increase. It seems like the DA wants to make sure the public knows they are involved.

Next up, big changes are happening in the church.

The next step is the election of a new pope. The Daily Maverick explains the mysteries of the conclave – the process of electing a new Pope.
