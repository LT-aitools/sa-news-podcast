Our top story today is the conviction in the Joshlin Smith case. A year after the disappearance of six-year-old Joshlin Smith, her mother, Racquel "Kelly" Smith, her mother's boyfriend, Jacquen Appollis, and their friend, Steveno van Rhyn, have been found guilty of human trafficking. Judge Nathan Erasmus delivered the verdict on Friday in the Western Cape Division of the High Court sitting in Saldanha Bay. The accused did not take the stand during the eight-week trial, leaving many questions unanswered, particularly regarding Joshlin’s whereabouts. The minimum sentence for human trafficking is life imprisonment.
