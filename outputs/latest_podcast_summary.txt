Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Tuesday, June 24th, 2025.

First up, we have a major development regarding the murder of a Hawks official.

Twelve members of the South African National Defence Force, or SANDF, have been arrested in connection with the 2023 murder of Lieutenant Colonel Ngwako Frans Mathipa, a member of the Hawks. At the time of his death, Mathipa was investigating these same SANDF members for a case involving kidnapping and murder. This story has developed quickly over the past day with the original article claiming that the case also involved a fake hijacking and potential links to ISIS.

Our next story involves the ongoing fallout from the Israeli-Iran conflict.

While the international community watches on, the situation has global implications, as major airlines have suspended flights to the Middle East. The ongoing conflict has led to increased no-go airspace, impacting travel for many. The US bombing probably caused "very significant" damage to the underground areas of Iran's Fordow uranium enrichment plant dug into a mountain.
