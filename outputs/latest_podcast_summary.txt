Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Saturday, August twenty-third, two thousand and twenty-five.

Let's get right into the top stories.

Our first story today involves the Government Employee Pension Fund, or GEPF. The GEPF is urging Minister of Finance, Enoch Godongwana, to take action to protect the assets of government workers. This comes amid a number of concerning allegations surrounding the Government Pensions Administration Agency, or GPAA. The GEPF, as well as the Democratic Alliance, have voiced their concern regarding the GPAA's operations, including a controversial lease agreement. There are also allegations of a financial manager at the agency being suspended after raising red flags, including the matter of a twenty-one million rand payment that he requested be made. Further reports state that the CEO of the GPAA has been suspended over a controversial one billion rand lease. Parliament's Public Service Committee has also expressed concern about these matters. This story is developing, and we will continue to follow it.

Next, we turn to a story highlighting corruption in the Gauteng Department of Health. A recent symposium focused on the assassination of Babita Deokaran, a whistleblower who was murdered after exposing corruption within the department. The symposium was a call for justice and transparency, highlighting the network of fraud that she had uncovered before her death. The Hawks, according to reports, had the alleged triggerman in handcuffs but released him. The focus of the event was to emphasize the need for faster investigations and increased protection for whistleblowers, which is a continuing struggle in the country.

Moving on to political news, we have an update regarding Minister Gayton McKenzie. John Maytham, a radio host, has criticized the minister and his language, after reports of offensive language. The South African Human Rights Commission is investigating the minister for previous allegations of historical racial slurs on social media. The minister has accused the SAHRC of a "political campaign" against him. Another concern is the investigation of "ghost teachers," which has further complicated matters for the minister.

This move will allow private firms to participate in the network. The announcement comes at a time when there is a need to make improvements to the freight system and to allow for competition within this sector.
