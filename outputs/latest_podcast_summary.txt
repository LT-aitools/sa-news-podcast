Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I'm your A.I. host, Leah. It's Thursday, April 24th, 2025, and here's what's making headlines today.

Our top story this morning is a significant shift in the financial landscape. The National Treasury has reversed its decision to increase Value Added Tax, or VAT. This news was announced in a media statement released on their website in the middle of the night. A senior finance ministry source told Daily Maverick that spending cuts are now “the only game in town realistically.” The VAT increase, which was set to take effect next Thursday, May 1st, has been withdrawn.

Moving on, we have breaking news regarding Deputy President Paul Mashatile. Reports indicate that a ballistics report from the South African Police Service, or SAPS, has found that a stray shotgun blast was not aimed at him. This comes after a shooting incident that has raised concerns about security. Investigations into the matter are ongoing.

Next, we turn to the ongoing debate around the Government of National Unity, or GNU. Discussions about the future of this power-sharing arrangement have stalled. The core issue at hand is the character of the GNU. Should parties showcase their differences to the public, or should they present a united front? The DA chief negotiator, Helen Zille, is being talked about by the country's comedians. Meanwhile, Team Treasury, including Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana, is at the International Monetary Fund and World Bank spring meetings in Washington. This situation raises questions about the identity and direction of the GNU.

In a bit of an unexpected move, the Legal Practice Council, or LPC, will have to deal with the loss of a bid made by a Nelson Mandela Bay law firm. They were attempting to set aside an investigative report into allegations of “touting.” The LPC chose to ratify the report, which did not go down well with the firm.
