Our top story today: The ANC has thrown a spanner in the works of the Government of National Unity. The ANCâ€™s National Working Committee has resolved to 'reset' its relationship with the Democratic Alliance, or DA. Sources say the ANC has accused the DA of acting as an opposition force. This decision opens the door to potential real change within the government, but could also create unrest within the ANC itself. More details are expected in the coming days, as the ANC plans to engage with other parties about the budget over the next five days.
