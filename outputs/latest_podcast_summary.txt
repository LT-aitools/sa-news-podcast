**Leah:** Alright, let's dive straight into the headlines for today, April 4th, 2025. We've got a lot to unpack, so let's get started.

First up, we have a major development brewing in the political arena. It seems the DA is seriously considering pulling out of the Government of National Unity, or the GNU, that was formed after the last elections. Now, this comes after a vote on the fiscal framework, where the DA voted against the proposals that have raised the value-added tax. DA Federal Council chairperson, Helen Zille, has stated the party's next move is to head to the courts. This decision could have some serious implications for the future of our government and the stability of the country, especially given President Ramaphosa's desire to expand the GNU. It's definitely a story we'll be following closely in the coming days.

**Leah:** Shifting gears now, and we move to a story that hits close to home for many: the state of our cities. Joburg's Mayor, Kabelo Gwamanda, is facing a significant backlash over proposed tariff hikes for the city. Civil society groups and various political parties are criticizing these proposed increases, saying that the tariff hikes are unjustifiable and will have a disproportionately negative impact on the vulnerable members of our communities. With the financial strains already felt by so many, this story is raising some serious questions about the city's priorities. We'll be keeping an eye on how this plays out, as it's a critical issue for residents across the city.

**Leah:** Now, a story about another contentious issue – alleged neglect and abuse of the elderly in a Cape Town assisted living facility. A former resident of Lilac Residence Seapark has lodged a criminal complaint, bringing to light serious allegations of neglect and abuse. The facility has denied the accusations, setting the stage for what is sure to be a complex and sensitive legal battle. The situation raises important questions about the standard of care and the protection of vulnerable people in our society. This is a heartbreaking situation, and the public will be awaiting the outcomes.

**Leah:** On another note, the fallout from the proposed government changes has reached the JSE. The JSE has suffered a massive R1-trillion rout, which is a direct result of both Trump's tariffs, and fears about the government’s plans. This is a time of uncertainty, and a huge challenge for the country as we have to deal with the financial losses due to external pressure.
