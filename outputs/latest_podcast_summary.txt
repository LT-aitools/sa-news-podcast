Leah: Our top story today focuses on the political landscape. The Democratic Alliance, or the DA, is warning of potential losses on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, the JSE, if the party is excluded from the Government of National Unity, or GNU. Steenhuisen, the leader of the DA, is reaffirming their commitment to the GNU, while other sources suggest negotiations are underway to keep the coalition afloat. However, the exclusion of DA is not set in stone. We will keep you updated as the situation develops.

Leah: Moving on, there's some troubling news coming out of KwaZulu-Natal. A close ally of former President Zuma, Roy Moodley, is facing accusations of capturing top KZN prosecutors. The details are still emerging, but the allegations suggest a potential compromise of the justice system.

Leah: Turning our attention to another critical area, there's growing concern about the South African military. News24 reports that despite billions of Rands in spending over the past 19 years, the military still lacks essential combat vehicles. This raises serious questions about resource allocation and the state of our defense capabilities.

Leah: Now, let's talk about a rather unusual legal case. A man who attempted to smuggle millions out of South Africa has been ordered to pay R200,000. This case highlights the ongoing challenges in combating financial crime and protecting the country's assets.

Leah: And now for our final headline. The tragic situation unfolding in a small Eastern Cape town where rape is described as "a sentence served by women" is a heartbreaking story that needs highlighting. This has made international news as a 7-year-old girl in the town was also allegedly raped. IOL are reporting that the DNA results are due to come out.

Leah: Switching gears now, from the hard news to some positive economic news. The Mail & Guardian are reporting on the positive outlook in real estate. Several listed property funds, or REITs, are booming, reporting strong results for the interim period ending December. Many in South Africa are confident, and they are investing in real estate. Growthpoint Properties, the largest landlord in South Africa, delivered results that were better than expected.
