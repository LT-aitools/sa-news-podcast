Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah.

Today is Monday, the eighteenth of August, two thousand and twenty-five. Here's what's making headlines:

First up, a concerning warning from within the African National Congress. Senzo Mchunu is raising the alarm, stating that the ANC is on the brink of collapse and that urgent action is needed. No further details are available at this time.

Next, we turn our attention to the National Dialogue. The dialogue, intended to bridge the gap between citizens and state officials, appears to be exposing deep rifts instead. Reports suggest the dialogue has raised doubts about its potential impact. Multiple sources have stated that the government is shutting out voices. The lack of action from the dialogue has led to it being called an echo chamber.

Further details are not available, but this development raises serious concerns about the municipality's financial oversight.
