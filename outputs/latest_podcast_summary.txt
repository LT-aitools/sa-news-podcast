Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Wednesday, the tenth of September, 2025. Let's get straight into the headlines.

Our top story today concerns a tragic hostage situation in Mamelodi, Pretoria. A South African Police Service constable, reportedly experiencing personal difficulties, held family members hostage for approximately twelve hours. The standoff ended in the worst possible way, with the constable and a nephew found dead. Multiple news outlets, including IOL and News24, are reporting on the incident, which has shocked the community and raised questions about mental health support for law enforcement officers.

Next, let's move on to economics and international relations. President Cyril Ramaphosa has dismissed suggestions that South Africa is “groveling” to the United States in trade negotiations. This comes after comments from EFF leader Julius Malema, who alleged that South Africa was conceding to US demands to reduce tariffs. President Ramaphosa stated that South Africa would not negotiate with the US "on bended knees" while officials are currently in the United States for talks. The focus is on addressing existing tariffs.

In other news, the Constitutional Court is set to decide on a case that could have significant implications for healthcare workers. The case, brought by trade union Solidarity, challenges sections of the National Health Act. The legal dispute centers on whether doctors should have the freedom to choose where they work, or if the state can dictate their placement. News24 and other outlets are reporting on the argument. The outcome of this case will affect the National Health Act and potentially health equality, as the Department of Health appeals the ruling.

Switching gears to the economy, the South African Revenue Service, or SARS, has clarified its focus on a new group of taxpayers: social media influencers. Several reports from BusinessTech and News24 confirm that SARS is stepping up efforts to ensure full tax compliance among influencers and content creators. Some influencers have already expressed dissatisfaction with this push for full tax compliance. This move signifies SARS's increasing attention to the digital economy and online income streams.
