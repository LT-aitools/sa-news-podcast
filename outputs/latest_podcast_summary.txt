**Intro music**

Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Friday, June twenty-seventh, two thousand and twenty-five.

We have a lot to get through today, so let’s dive straight in.

Our top story today concerns the ongoing crisis within South Africa's Crime Intelligence division. Several articles from News24, BusinessLIVE, EWN, Daily Maverick, and TimesLIVE are all reporting on the arrest of Crime Intelligence head, Dumisani Khumalo, at an airport. This marks yet another scandal for the division, and the Democratic Alliance has welcomed the arrest. The news follows earlier reports of the arrest of a BMW brigadier and the alleged “downfall” of a top cop spook. Investigations are ongoing, and the full extent of the impact of these events are still emerging.

Next, we move to a political development concerning the Democratic Alliance and President Cyril Ramaphosa. Daily Maverick and News24 are reporting on a serious situation. DA leader John Steenhuisen has issued a forty-eight-hour ultimatum to President Ramaphosa, following the axing of Deputy Minister Andrew Whitfield. Steenhuisen has demanded that the ANC take action. The situation is developing rapidly, with ramifications that could significantly impact the political landscape. Presidency sources, however, have indicated that Ramaphosa does not feel the need to explain the Whitfield firing.

Now, let's switch gears to a legal matter. IOL and News24 report that the Gauteng High Court has ruled against suspended Road Accident Fund CEO, Collins Letsoalo. Letsoalo's urgent court bid to set aside his suspension was unsuccessful. Further details of the court's ruling are still coming in, but this decision represents a significant setback for Letsoalo.

We'll now discuss water supply and its disruptions. BusinessTech.co.za, the City of Ekurhuleni, and EWN are all reporting that Rand Water’s maintenance project next week will cause widespread water outages. These outages will affect Joburg, Pretoria, and Ekurhuleni for sixteen days. While Rand Water claims the disruption will be minimal, residents are advised to prepare.

Finally, let’s look at the political fallout from the Joburg mayoral situation. EWN is reporting on the aftermath of a no-confidence vote. ActionSA, having abstained from the vote, says the problem lies with Dada Morero and not the ANC. The situation remains dynamic.
