Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah.

Today is Wednesday, the fourth of June, 2025. Let's dive straight into the headlines.

Our top story today is the reshuffling within the MK party. Floyd Shivambu, previously the party's Secretary-General, has been moved to the backbenches of Parliament. Various sources, including TimesLIVE and News24, report that this move has been met with celebration by some MK party leaders. The reasons cited include Shivambu's perceived arrogance. This shakeup comes after criticism he faced since his arrival from the EFF.

Next, we turn to a story of interest to beachgoers in Durban. Swimming has been banned at Durban beaches due to the annual Sardine Run. EThekwini Municipality has removed shark nets to facilitate the migration. The Sardine Run is an incredible natural phenomenon and a big deal for local fisherman.

Now, let's talk about your wallet. Petrol and diesel prices are set to drop at midnight. Motorists will see some relief at the pumps, as various sources, including SowetanLIVE and BusinessLIVE, report that prices are going down. However, a fuel levy hike is also taking effect, so while the price at the pump may dip, it will not be as much as one may have hoped.

In other news, a court has ruled in the asbestos case involving Ace Magashule. His assistant's extradition from the United States was deemed unlawful, therefore she cannot be tried in the asbestos case. This ruling is a significant development, as reported by IOL and News24. The National Prosecuting Authority, or NPA, is also under scrutiny in this high-profile case.

Finally, let's look at the economy. South Africa's economy grew a dismal zero point one percent in the first quarter. BusinessLIVE and Daily Maverick report that this slow growth is causing concern. Mining is in what’s considered a “technical recession”. The government is also exploring a new inflation target, which could potentially lead to debt savings of up to eight hundred and seventy billion rand.
