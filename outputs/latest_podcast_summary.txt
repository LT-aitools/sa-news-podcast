Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Friday, the eleventh of July, 2025. Let's dive into the biggest headlines.

Our top story today: President Cyril Ramaphosa is facing tough choices regarding ministers in KwaZulu-Natal. Recent reports suggest that allegations against certain ministers are placing pressure on the President. He has to make decisions, and these decisions are expected to be announced soon. It is a complex situation with several angles, including explosive allegations against a high-profile figure. South Africa waits for the announcement with bated breath.

Next up: The ongoing investigation into the alleged collusion claims by the judiciary and Mr. Mkhwanazi is taking a new turn. The judiciary has challenged Mkhwanazi over the collusion claims, meaning they have questioned his allegations directly. This is significant because it shows the seriousness with which the judiciary is treating the accusations. As the case unfolds, the public is closely watching the developments.

It has been eighteen years, and there have been zero convictions related to foreign bribery. This has brought the global anti-corruption efforts into sharp focus.
