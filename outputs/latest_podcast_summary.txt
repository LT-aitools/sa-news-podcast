Our first story today focuses on the Government of National Unity, or GNU, and the African National Congress, or ANC. The ANC’s National Executive Committee, or NEC, has backed the GNU, but they are also open to seeking support from parties outside the current coalition. This comes amidst post-budget crisis discussions and ongoing policy disagreements. The ANC acknowledges the challenges, but President Cyril Ramaphosa maintains forming the GNU was the correct decision. The party is now looking to other political players for potential assistance.
