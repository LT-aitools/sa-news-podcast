Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Sunday, the fifteenth of June, two thousand and twenty-five. Let us jump straight into today's top stories.

Our first story is a concerning one. The South African Air Force is facing a major scandal, with parts worth eighty-five million rand from the VIP plane, a Falcon, vanishing. The situation is under investigation as security lapses are suspected.

Next, we turn to the devastating floods in the Eastern Cape. The death toll has sadly risen to eighty-six, with search and recovery operations ongoing. Residents are picking up the pieces after the deluge, with many still searching for missing loved ones.

The floods also brought with them a series of unfortunate events. There were reports of chaos and confusion, and one heartbreaking account tells of a grandmother whose three grandchildren were washed away. The floods and the devastation they wrought have highlighted the urgent need for aid and support to the affected communities.

Moving on, there's political drama brewing. Former Democratic Alliance Member of Parliament, Liam Jacobs, has quit the party and joined the Patriotic Alliance. Jacobs stated that he could not remain a part of the DA any longer. This shift has created quite a stir in the political landscape.

In other news, the Government of National Unity is celebrating its first anniversary. Analysts suggest that, a year in, the unity project has seen both friction and some green shoots, though there is a debate on whether enough has been done to transcend party lines. The formation of the GNU was a landmark moment, and many are watching to see how the coalition will continue to navigate the complexities of governing.

Also in the news, a major fuel tampering crackdown has resulted in the seizure of assets worth three hundred and sixty-seven million rand and almost one million litres of fuel. This highlights the ongoing efforts by authorities to combat illegal activities in the fuel industry and the scale of the illicit trade.

In an article from the Sunday Times, a recent court ruling found that the Prudential Authority had acted unlawfully when it objected to Sipho Pityana’s nomination as the bank’s chair. This decision is seen as a win for Pityana in his legal battle.

The Sunday Times also brings us the story of a construction manager who was kidnapped, with his kidnappers demanding ten million rand for his safe return. This case is another unfortunate reminder of the ongoing challenges with crime and the need for enhanced security measures.

An article from the Sunday Times mentions that Capitec's CEO is standing firm on his claim that the true unemployment rate is much lower than thirty-two percent, a figure reported by StatsSA. The CEO's stance is at odds with other economists.
