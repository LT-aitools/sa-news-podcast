**Leah:** Sawubona South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of the most important news coming out of the Republic. I'm your host, Leah. It's Saturday, the 5th of April, 2025, and we've got a lot to unpack today.

**Leah:** Let's dive right into the top stories making headlines.

**Leah:** First up, we're looking at the impact of those new US tariffs, and the fallout is hitting us hard. The US, under the Trump administration, has slapped tariffs on a wide range of goods, and our trade with them is taking a serious hit. Remember that picture from Karen Ewen of the fruit on the bird feeder? Well, that's what you'll be looking at if our economic woes continue.

**Leah:** A big chunk of our exports to the US are automotive-related, especially from the Eastern Cape. Now, those in the plants there are facing a double whammy: a VAT increase that affects everything they buy and a market that's suddenly not so viable for their products. Minister of Trade and Industry says SA plans to cast the net wider to protect our local industries. The MK Party is also calling out the tariffs, saying it will harm white SA farmers the most. Minister Godongwana says Treasury will discuss VAT replacement with all political parties. It's a tough situation, and the government is, thankfully, focusing on diplomacy over immediate retaliation.

**Leah:** Next, a very serious situation. Almost a year after the tragic George building collapse that claimed 34 lives, the details are still emerging. Minister of Human Settlements, Thembi Simelane, has revealed that regulatory lapses within the National Home Builders Registration Council played a key role in allowing the contractor to cut corners. It seems failures in the council's internal processes meant proper procedures weren't followed, leading to devastating consequences. This is a stark reminder of the importance of accountability and oversight in construction, to prevent future disasters.

**Leah:** Now, let's move onto a story with a legal twist. The Joshlin Smith case continues, and there's been a significant development. The court is debating whether to seal a statement made by one of the accused, Jacquen Appollis. The statement claims Appollis and another accused, Steveno van Rhyn, left Joshlin with someone else on the day she disappeared. Judge Nathan Erasmus must now weigh the public's right to information against protecting the integrity of the investigation. This will likely have ramifications for other cases of similar nature.

**Leah:** Next, we have a story about our educational system. Our Minister of Basic Education, Siviwe Gwarube, has admitted that the deadline to eradicate pit toilets at schools has been missed. This isn't a small oversight; it's a significant failure of governance. This failure is a major problem, and our government needs to take immediate actions.

**Leah:** In some other news...

*   **Mpox on the rise**: a new strain is spreading and more cases are being reported.
*   **Spotify**: Spotify has announced that they paid South African artists R400-million last year.
