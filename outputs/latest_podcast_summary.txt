Leah: Our top story today concerns the VAT. Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana is standing firm on a potential VAT increase. He argues that suspending the VAT hike would lead to severe consequences. This follows a challenge by the Democratic Alliance, who believe it’s a misinterpretation of the law. The minister has not revealed the exact details of the proposed hike.

Leah: The United States is planning to cut its diplomatic presence in Africa. A draft order from the Trump administration calls for a drastic restructuring of the U.S. State Department. This could lead to the closure of embassies and consulates across the continent. Mcebisi Jonas, who has been chosen as the next ambassador to the United States, has been criticised by his appointment by South African officials.
