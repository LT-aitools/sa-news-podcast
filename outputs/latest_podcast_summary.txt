Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Friday, August 15th, 2025, and here are your top stories.

Our first story focuses on the National Dialogue, a crucial platform for conversations about South Africa’s future. President Cyril Ramaphosa has slammed the boycotters of the National Dialogue, saying the dialogue is “the real tent where conversations take place.” The National Dialogue is meant to be the country’s democratic brainstorming session. However, concerns are being raised that the dialogue is straying from its original citizen-led vision and risks becoming another elite gathering, generating reports but little change.

Next up, the Democratic Alliance, or the DA, has unveiled former Tshwane mayor Cilliers Brink as its mayoral candidate for the 2026 elections. The DA is banking on Brink to, in their words, “rescue Tshwane.” This announcement follows a day that included the commencement of the national convention.

In other news, transport operators at Maponya Mall have agreed to coexist after a recent and tragic murder. However, tensions remain high in the e-hailing industry. In Soweto, residents have expressed their outrage following the murder of an e-hailing driver, stating "It stops here." The family of the deceased Uber driver, Mthokozisi Mvelase, is also mourning, as he had only started his new job on Monday. SANTACO has warned against violence, highlighting the urgency of the situation.

Finally, we turn to a sensitive issue concerning the South African National Defence Force, or SANDF. President Ramaphosa is set to hold discussions with the SANDF chief regarding an "ill-advised" visit to Iran. The DA has demanded a court-martial of the SANDF Chief for allegedly breaching military neutrality during the Iran visit. Growing calls are emerging for Ramaphosa to take action against the Defence Chief over controversial statements made during this trip.
