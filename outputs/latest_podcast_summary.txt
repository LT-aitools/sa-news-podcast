Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Sunday, July twenty-seventh, two thousand and twenty-five. Let's dive right in.

Our top story today: South Africans are in the news regarding the conflict in Ukraine. Reports indicate that several South Africans were arrested after they arrived in Ukraine, expecting medical roles. Instead, they found themselves undergoing military training. The details are still unfolding, but this has sparked concern and raised questions about the nature of the recruitment and the safety of South African citizens abroad.

Next, let us consider the issue of deportations to eSwatini, formerly known as Swaziland. There is growing outrage over the United States' policy of deporting violent criminals to eSwatini. Critics, including some from eSwatini's opposition, are calling the policy “human trafficking disguised as deportation.” This has reignited the debate around the US’s use of other African countries as a place to deport immigrants and the potential risks associated with these individuals being sent to eSwatini.

Now, let us turn to a significant political development. Former Chief Justice Raymond Zondo has publicly criticized President Cyril Ramaphosa, as well as the Hawks, regarding state capture. Zondo is blasting Ramaphosa over state capture, claiming that the current system gives party bosses too much power to control members of parliament. He went on to say South Africa is losing the war on corruption and blaming the Hawks’ ineffectiveness. These remarks are part of an ongoing debate about accountability and the government's efforts to combat corruption in the country.

Kunene's departure also means the Joburg council cannot investigate the matter anymore. This move has led to discussions regarding the state of political affairs.
