Our top story today is the fallout from the VAT increase U-turn. In a dramatic reversal, Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana has scrapped the planned point five percent VAT hike, just days before its intended implementation on the first of May. The Democratic Alliance, or DA, is claiming a major victory, asserting that their legal challenge was instrumental in this decision. They credit their court case and weeks of tension with the ANC as the driving force behind the reversal. However, other parties are also claiming victory, highlighting the political drama surrounding the Government of National Unity. The DA stated in their press conference that the ANC is repeatedly practicing deception.
