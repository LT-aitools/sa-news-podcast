Leah: Sawubona South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I'm your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Sunday, April 20th, 2025. Let's dive into the headlines.

Leah: Our top story today concerns Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana's defense of the proposed VAT increase. The Minister is arguing that the Democratic Alliance’s challenge to the VAT Act is “misdirected” and based on a “fundamental misinterpretation” of the law. Godongwana warns of “severe consequences” if the hike is suspended. This comes as the DA and the EFF are preparing to head to court in an attempt to get the VAT hike suspended.

Leah: In other news, the Road Accident Fund, or RAF, is back in court, dragging the South African Revenue Service, or SARS, back for contempt. This is the second round in this legal battle. No details are currently available, but the case seems to be ongoing.

Leah: Shifting gears, we have a concerning report from News24 that the army is looking to spend one hundred and eighty million rand to purchase another potentially “dodgy” building. Details on the specifics of the building have yet to be revealed, but the news raises further questions about the army’s spending practices.

Leah: In politics, there is a developing story regarding the appointment of a Special Envoy to the US, Mcebisi Jonas. The Department of International Relations and Cooperation, or DIRCO, has denounced a fabricated interview attributed to him, denying that any interview took place. This follows criticism of the appointment, with some figures suggesting a pastor would have been a better choice. The DA and the EFF head to court to get the VAT hike suspended.

Leah: Finally, there's news regarding the Easter pilgrimage to Moria. Thousands of people are making their way there. Putco is reporting that they are safely transporting thousands to Moria as the ZCC pilgrimage returns after a five-year pause.

Leah: That's your Mzansi Lowdown for today.

Leah: Thank you for tuning in. I'm Leah, signing off.
