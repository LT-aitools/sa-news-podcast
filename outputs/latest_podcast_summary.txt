Turning to Eskom, Minister of Electricity Kgosientsho Ramokgopa has apologised, admitting to management and planning failures that have contributed to the return of load shedding. He stated that the latest round of blackouts is due to management and planning issues and not machinery-related problems. Eskom has announced that Stage Two load shedding will be implemented during the evening peak periods.
