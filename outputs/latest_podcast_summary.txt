Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I'm your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Thursday, the 8th of May, 2025.

Let's get right into it, starting with a story that should concern every South African: corruption.

Allegations of systemic corruption at the Eastern Cape Division of the High Court in Mthatha have been corroborated by the Southern Africa Accountability Journalism Project. Court officials are reportedly soliciting bribes from attorneys to perform routine administrative functions. This is a direct attack on the integrity of our justice system, and it's crucial that these allegations are thoroughly investigated and those responsible are held accountable. We will keep an eye on this story as it develops.

Next, we have a story from Johannesburg that deals with the current state of the city.

Mayor Dada Morero has announced a turnaround plan for Johannesburg, including a "bomb squad" to tackle the city's "deepest crises." This follows a visit from President Cyril Ramaphosa to the city last month. The plan includes various initiatives aimed at addressing the city's challenges. The details of this plan are still emerging, but the focus is on getting Johannesburg back on track.

Now, let's look at the situation in our health services.

The Charlotte Maxeke Academic Hospital in Johannesburg is struggling with basic patient needs. There are reported shortages of food and hot water, which affects the ability of health workers to provide care. Some patients have allegedly asked to be discharged due to hunger. This is a serious situation that demands immediate attention. The hospital is one of the major healthcare facilities in Gauteng, and its ability to provide adequate care is a significant concern.

Next, we turn to politics and the important issue of job creation.

The government is modeling a 3.5% growth by 2029 and has launched 30 key reforms as part of Operation Vulindlela Phase 2. This initiative is focused on infrastructure, energy, and local government. These reforms are aimed at improving the country's economic prospects. The government believes that these changes are essential for unlocking growth and creating employment opportunities. It's an ambitious plan, and we'll be following its progress closely.
