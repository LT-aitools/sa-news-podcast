Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Thursday, the fourth of September, 2025. Let us dive into the top stories.

First up, the leadership crisis within the National Prosecuting Authority, or NPA, is deepening. A News24 article reports that the paralysis in the presidency is exacerbating the issue of who will lead the NPA. This is a critical matter, as it impacts the entire justice system in South Africa.

Turning to the Western Cape, the mayor of Stellenbosch has confirmed an investigation into a leaked video. The video reportedly contains comments calling for the removal of white people from the municipality. TimesLIVE and News24 are following this story, which has triggered a strong reaction from various political parties and community groups. The Democratic Alliance is also involved. This highlights the ongoing challenges around transformation and race relations within local government.

Moving onto the economy, a News24 article highlights the government's installation of smart electricity meters. The cost of these meters is about seven thousand five hundred rand each, and the article questions whether this investment will be worthwhile. While Treasury aims to deploy these meters across eighteen municipalities, the long-term impact on Eskom’s debt remains to be seen.

Finally, the North West province continues to face challenges, according to a News24 report. Residents are bearing the brunt of what the article describes as a "culture of recklessness" within municipalities. This includes issues such as unpaid bonuses for council members, unpaid garbage removal, and dry taps. The problems seem to be affecting service delivery and raising concerns about corruption and mismanagement.
