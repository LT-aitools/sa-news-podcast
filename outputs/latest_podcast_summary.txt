Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I'm your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Wednesday, the 30th of April, 2025, and here's what's making headlines.

First up, we have some tragic news out of Gauteng. Five bodies have been recovered from the Hennops River in Centurion, Tshwane. Heartbreakingly, three of the deceased are police constables who had been reported missing.

Brazil, as the chair, issued a statement against trade protectionism. This will continue to be a sensitive topic as BRICS nations attempt cooperation again in July.
