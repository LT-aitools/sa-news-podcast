Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Sunday, the 29th of June, 2025.

Let's get right into it:

Our top story today concerns the Democratic Alliance, or DA, and their stance within the Government of National Unity, or GNU. Following President Ramaphosa’s decision to remove Deputy Minister Whitfield, the DA considered withdrawing from the GNU. However, the DA has decided to remain in the GNU, with their leader, John Steenhuisen, prevailing in a meeting. The party has, however, withdrawn from the National Dialogue and announced they will vote against the budgets of several ANC ministers accused of corruption.

Next, we turn to a significant development within the African National Congress, or ANC. Reports indicate that several members of the ANC's National Executive Committee, or NEC, want the DA to be removed from the GNU. This reflects growing tensions within the coalition government.
