Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Monday, June thirtieth, twenty twenty-five. Let's dive right in.

Our top story today: Political tensions are heating up. The Democratic Alliance, or DA, has withdrawn from the National Dialogue and has vowed to vote against departmental budgets for what they call corrupt African National Congress, or ANC, ministers. This comes amidst a backdrop of growing strain within the Government of National Unity, or GNU. Former Minister of Transport, Fikile Mbalula, has responded, daring the DA to "pack its bags". Meanwhile, President Cyril Ramaphosa remains firm on the axing of former Deputy Minister of Trade and Industry, Andrew Whitfield. Whitfield, however, will be returning to Nelson Mandela Bay to coordinate the DA's campaign for the local government elections in twenty twenty-six, with the goal of securing an outright majority. The ANC is taking the DA's threats seriously, indicating a complex political landscape ahead.
