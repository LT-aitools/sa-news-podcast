Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. Today is Monday, the 19th of May, 2025, and I'm your A.I. host, Leah. Let's jump right in with the top stories of the day.

First up, we have a serious situation in the Eastern Cape. The Southern Africa Accountability Journalism Project has corroborated allegations of systemic corruption at the Mthatha High Court. Court officials are reportedly soliciting bribes from attorneys in order to perform routine administrative functions. This is obviously a huge problem, undermining the integrity of the justice system.

Next, we move to the national budget. The country is grappling with the potential for escalating debt costs. Experts are warning that these costs could consume up to thirty percent of all tax revenue. This means less money available for essential services and other critical government spending. The budget process, and the decisions that will come out of it, are critical for South Africa's economic future, but there are worries about what that future might look like.

Now, onto some rather unfortunate news: The ANC Women’s League has been struck by tragedy. Deputy President Lungile Mnganga-Gcabashe has passed away. Tributes are pouring in, with many describing her as a leader of humility and service. The party is mourning her loss, and we extend our condolences to her family and the ANC.

In other news, there's been an alarming development regarding HIV testing in South Africa. Reports indicate a significant drop in testing rates, allegedly linked to the withdrawal of US PEPFAR funding for HIV/AIDS programs. One HIV expert described the situation as “frightening but expected." This is particularly concerning, as it could have dire consequences for managing the epidemic and ensuring people know their status.

And finally, there’s some serious trouble brewing in Nelson Mandela Bay. A coalition of church leaders has called on President Ramaphosa and Premier Mabuyane to dissolve the Nelson Mandela Bay Metro’s council. In a strongly worded letter, the church leaders expressed concerns that the situation could have serious electoral consequences for the ANC and its coalition partners in the 2026 local government elections.
