Our top story today involves a deepening scandal within the South African Police Service, or SAPS. Former head of Crime Intelligence, Richard Mkhwanazi, has implicated a number of prominent figures, including Police Minister Bheki Cele and Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, Thembi Nchunu, in the Madlanga Commission spotlight. Mkhwanazi alleges that the Presidency also interfered in SAPS deployment decisions. Furthermore, he makes sweeping accusations of criminal capture and points towards malicious corruption-busters and intelligence leaks. The accusations tie back to the arrest of a Mr. Khumalo, allegedly linked to blocking an organized crime probe. The scope of this alleged corruption is currently under investigation.
