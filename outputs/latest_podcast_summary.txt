Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Monday, the twenty-fifth of August, two thousand and twenty-five. Let's get straight to the headlines.

Our top story today involves a high-profile figure and a series of unanswered calls. News24 reports that Police Minister Bheki Cele made ten missed calls in an attempt to reach "Cat" Matlala, a prominent figure in the tender process. The details of the call remain unknown, and this is where the story picks up from.

Now, onto a concerning trend in South African schools. News24 has highlighted a growing problem: an increase in rude and litigious parents. Schools are reporting that they are becoming "soft targets" for individuals expressing their frustrations, potentially leading to disruption and legal battles.

The next major story relates to international diplomacy, with implications for South Africa. President Cyril Ramaphosa is in ongoing high-level talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and French President Emmanuel Macron, focusing on peace efforts between Russia and Ukraine. Discussions also involve other European leaders, and South Africa is joining the global push for a peaceful resolution to the conflict. The President has also received a briefing from Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Shifting focus, another story about the economy is making waves. According to News24, private sector companies are stepping onto South Africa's rail network. This opens the door for private firms to operate freight trains, with several transport operating companies being approved. This is another state monopoly being challenged and, it is hoped, that this will contribute to improving efficiency and possibly reducing costs.

In other news, the Department of International Relations and Cooperation is facing scrutiny over South Africa's involvement in the International Court of Justice genocide case against Israel. The Director-General, Zane Dangor, who is the lead architect of the case, will answer questions on the way forward.

Finally, a story with a political angle. Naledi Pandor, a former Minister, has expressed concerns about the image of the African National Congress (ANC). She stated that the party is regarded by many with "horror and shame," a reflection of its declining support base. This is a discussion on the current state of South African politics, that is still ongoing.

That's all the news for today, folks.
