Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I'm your A.I. host, Leah. It's Friday, May 9th, 2025, and here's your quick rundown of today's top stories.

First up, we have a story that's shaking the foundation of justice in the Eastern Cape. Investigations by the Southern Africa Accountability Journalism Project have corroborated allegations of systemic corruption at the Mthatha High Court. Court officials are allegedly soliciting bribes from attorneys to perform routine administrative functions. This paints a grim picture of the integrity of our legal system, and the implications are far-reaching.

Next, we head to Parliament. Yesterday, there was a heated debate around the impact of global white supremacist movements on white nationalism in South Africa. Political parties, and social media, were criticised for seemingly fanning the flames of division in the country. The debate highlights the ongoing challenges of addressing racial tensions and the legacy of inequality in our society.

Now, letâ€™s shift gears to another major development. The US government's plans to resettle Afrikaners as refugees have been challenged by Dirco, the Department of International Relations and Cooperation. Dirco is arguing that the US claims of discrimination against Afrikaners are baseless. This is a significant diplomatic move, and it raises questions about the motivations behind this controversial resettlement plan.

In a different light, we have some concerning news coming out of the Western Cape. Residents are being urged to prepare for a cold front this weekend, which is expected to bring strong to gale-force winds and large waves, starting tonight. Authorities are warning of potential hazards including uprooted trees, damaged roofs, runaway fires and disrupted coastal activities. It's a reminder to stay informed, stay safe, and take the necessary precautions.

Finally, let's touch on the ongoing state of joburg. After the State of the City Address by Mayor Dada Morero, residents shared their views on the metro. Reports show that residents continue to voice concerns regarding crime, instability, and the non-delivery of essential services. This reflects the ongoing challenges faced by Johannesburg in providing a functional and reliable environment for its residents.
