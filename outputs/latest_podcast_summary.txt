Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Thursday, September eleventh, two thousand and twenty-five. Let us dive into the biggest stories making headlines today.

Our first story focuses on a developing situation in Cape Town.

Following nearly a week without water, Westbury and Coronationville residents protested on Wednesday. This led to a tense standoff with the police, who used stun grenades, tear gas, and rubber bullets to disperse the crowd. Several residents and a Daily Maverick reporter were injured by the rubber bullets. This crisis in Joburg highlights the ongoing water shortages plaguing the city. Protests are growing more common as the water crisis deepens. A Daily Maverick article also mentioned that the Johannesburg Water Forum has been tracking the taps for months.

Our second top story shifts to the political arena.

In a significant development, there is a tug-of-war erupting over police commissioner Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi's testimony. MPs are angry that Mkhwanazi's appearance at a commission of inquiry investigating his allegations will take precedence over his giving evidence to Parliament. Simultaneously, Acting Police Minister Firoz Cachalia acknowledged that intelligence plans to tackle Cape Town gang violence are still not fully in place. In related news, six more people were murdered in shootings just hours after Cachalia acknowledged the lack of a comprehensive plan to tackle gang violence.
