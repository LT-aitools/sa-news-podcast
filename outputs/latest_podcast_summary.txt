Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Sunday, the seventh of September, 2025. Let's get right to it.

Our top stories for today: A tragic day for the South African Police Service, a rare celestial event is set to light up the night sky, and provinces continue to neglect recommendations from the Auditor-General. We will also cover MultiChoice’s announcement and the concerning spread of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Let us begin with a somber story. Twenty-seven members of the South African Police Service, including a twenty-six-year-old officer with less than one year of service, have been honored, having lost their lives in the line of duty. This heartbreaking event highlights the dangers faced by our law enforcement officers. High-ranking officials, including Deputy President Paul Mashatile, have vowed to combat attacks on police officers with the full force of the law, and have also promised to expose police officials who are working with criminals.

TimesLIVE reports that many provincial governments are not adhering to the Auditor-General's advice, potentially leading to continued financial mismanagement and a lack of transparency. This ongoing disregard raises serious concerns about accountability and the responsible use of public funds.
