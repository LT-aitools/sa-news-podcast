Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I'm your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Sunday, the 11th of May, 2025.

First up, a story that has the potential to shake up the foundations of our justice system:

Allegations of systemic corruption are surfacing at the Eastern Cape Division of the High Court in Mthatha. Investigations by the Southern Africa Accountability Journalism Project have revealed that court officials are reportedly soliciting bribes from attorneys. These bribes are allegedly being requested in exchange for performing routine administrative tasks. The situation is raising serious concerns about the integrity of the court and the accessibility of justice for all citizens.

Next, we turn to a scandal in the world of finance.

The former chair of Daybreak Foods, Bojane Segooa, has resigned with immediate effect. This comes just hours after a reported payment of six hundred twenty-five thousand rand. The circumstances surrounding her departure are now under scrutiny, especially given reports of dying chickens and unpaid salaries for staff. This situation highlights the many challenges facing the company.

Now, to a case that is a reminder of the persistent challenges facing South Africa:

The ongoing saga of missing journalist Aserie Ndlovu takes another turn. Police are actively seeking suspects in connection with the murder of Ndlovu and his partner. Preliminary investigations indicate that the victims were killed execution-style, with police sources confirming the use of a shotgun. The African Media Communication Forum, or AMCF, has pledged to help run Ndlovuâ€™s station after his disappearance. DNA results are still pending, and the NPA is holding off on any murder charges until those are received.

Let's talk about municipal woes.

The City of Johannesburg is facing many challenges. Crime and instability are problems that are keeping the city from being the best version of itself. Residents express frustration with issues like crime and non-delivery of services, issues that have plagued the city and continue to impact daily life. The need for sustainable solutions is vital.
