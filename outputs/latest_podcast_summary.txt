Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Friday, the 4th of July, 2025. Let's dive into the biggest stories of the day.

First up, we have the passing of former Deputy President David Mabuza. President Cyril Ramaphosa confirmed the news on Thursday evening, stating that Mabuza deserves our appreciation for his deep commitment to the liberation struggle and to the nation’s development as an inclusive, prosperous, democratic state. Tributes are pouring in, with politicians remembering him as resilient, strategic, and clever. However, there is controversy as Minister of Transport Fikile Mbalula may be in hot water for confirming Mabuza’s death before the official announcement.

Next, we turn our attention to the ongoing court case involving twelve SANDF members accused of murder. The state is painting a grim picture of the army's special forces. The case relates to the murder of Hawks detective Frans Mathipa. The bail application for the twelve SANDF officials has been adjourned. According to reports, the subpoena triggered veiled threats before the Mathipa murder.

In other news, fractures are deepening within the Government of National Unity, or GNU, as actions by the Democratic Alliance, or DA, are causing friction among coalition partners. The DA has withdrawn from the National Dialogue and plans to vote against departmental budgets for corrupt African National Congress, or ANC, ministers. Other parties are supporting Minister Nkabane’s education budget vote, choosing to stay out of the ANC/DA spat.
