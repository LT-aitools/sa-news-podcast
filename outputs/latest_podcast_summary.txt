Now, we shift gears to focus on the critical issue of border security. The Border Management Authority, or BMA, is introducing traceable stamps to tighten border security. This initiative is aimed at combating fraud, as the BMA works to combat fraudulent passports with fraudulent stamps. Furthermore, the BMA has recorded over nine thousand arrests and deportations between April and June this year.
