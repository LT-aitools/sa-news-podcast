Our top story today focuses on the inner circle of Deputy President Paul Mashatile and their connection to the new lottery operator, Sizekhaya Holdings. A recent investigation by AmaBhungane and News24, reveals a web of close ties between Mashatile and key figures in the new lottery company. The investigation, backed by pictures and video, highlights Sbu Shabalala, the former chief executive of Adapt IT, as a significant link within this network. This comes as the lottery license has been awarded, raising questions about how elite networks shape government contracts in South Africa. The evaluators of the lottery license allegedly lacked any experience in lottery operations, adding further scrutiny to the process.
