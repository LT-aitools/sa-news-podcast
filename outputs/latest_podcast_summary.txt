**Leah:** Our top story today concerns the escalating tensions within our very own coalition government. It appears the ANC and the DA are at loggerheads again. Recent actions and decisions by the DA have ruffled some feathers, and the ANC is not holding back. *Daily Maverick* reports that the cracks are deepening, with the ANC’s chief whip calling for consequences. President Ramaphosa is also rejecting external interference. It looks like the future of this partnership is hanging by a thread. The question on everyone's mind: Can they patch things up, or are we heading for a political shake-up? Only time will tell.

**Leah:** Next up, we have a concerning story about potential cuts to crucial funding. *Spotlightnsp.co.za* is reporting that the sudden and severe US cuts to grants from the world’s largest health research funder threaten to unravel the medical research landscape in South Africa. This will likely impact the medical field and the breakthroughs that medical researchers can potentially have. This also raises a critical question: Will our government seize this opportunity to bolster our own research capabilities? It's certainly a time to watch out for future developments.
