Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I'm your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Monday, the 28th of April, 2025. Let's dive into the top stories.

First up, a major win for South Africans: the looming VAT increase has been halted. The High Court has stepped in, putting a stop to the planned rise and ordering the Minister of Finance, Godongwana, to cover legal costs incurred by the Democratic Alliance, or DA, and the Economic Freedom Fighters, or EFF. This follows weeks of debate and legal challenges, ultimately resulting in a victory for those opposing the increase.

Next, we turn to politics. Following the court’s decision on VAT, the DA has indicated its commitment to remaining in the Government of National Unity, or GNU, after a "constructive" meeting with the African National Congress, or ANC. However, the DA still needed to file an affidavit for the court to issue an order to stop the VAT increase.

In other political news, there’s been significant debate surrounding the government's stance on the issue of Taiwan, which led to a protest by the ANC.

Also, the Acting President, Mr. Mantashe, is scheduled to deliver the Freedom Day Keynote address today.
