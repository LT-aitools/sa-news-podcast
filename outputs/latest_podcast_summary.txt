Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Wednesday, the second of July, 2025.

Let's dive right into the top stories.

First up, we have a developing political drama. The battle lines are being drawn in the Government of National Unity, or GNU, with the Democratic Alliance, or DA, launching attacks on the African National Congress, or ANC. Several sources report on this, including News24, eNCA, and the Daily Maverick. The DA is vowing to root out corruption within the government, and has already opened a criminal complaint against the Higher Education Minister, Dr. Nobuhle Nkabane. The DA has also laid criminal charges against Minister Nkabane over alleged "lies" to Parliament in connection to the Seta scandal. Furthermore, a student grouping is calling for her to be fired.
