Our top story today concerns the crisis gripping South Africa's healthcare system. Reports from *TimesLIVE*, *Daily Maverick*, and *Sunday World* paint a grim picture. Public hospitals and clinics across the country are under extreme strain. Many facilities are struggling to fill critical vacancies, and they are unable to acquire essential equipment and supplies. Doctors are sounding the alarm, citing crippling cuts at major hospitals and a shortage of specialists that threatens healthcare sustainability. This follows a recent investigation of KwaZulu-Natal hospitals, which revealed that many are barely on life support.
