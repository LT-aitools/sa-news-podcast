Leah: Sawubona South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of the most important news coming out of the Republic. I'm your host, Leah. It's Sunday, April 6th, 2025, and we've got a lot to unpack today. Let's dive right in!

First up, we're keeping a close eye on the political landscape. The Democratic Alliance (DA) is warning of potential economic consequences, including potential JSE losses, if they are excluded from the government. We're also seeing continued discussions around the Government of National Unity (GNU), with parties actively working to resolve the current political crisis. It seems the budget talks are going on late into the night, with top ANC officials reportedly kept in the dark about certain negotiations. This could potentially impact the stability of the government. It's a tricky situation, and the pressure is definitely on to find common ground.

Leah: Next up, let's look at some developments in the fight against crime and corruption. We've got a story about a Zuma ally, Roy Moodley, who is accused of capturing top KZN prosecutors. A recent investigation suggests this may have allowed him to control the legal proceedings in his favor.

There's also a concerning report about an alleged kidnapping kingpin, Faizel Charloos. He was rearrested after fleeing court this week, and is believed to be linked to a series of abductions. Authorities are expressing confidence in bringing him to justice. We'll be following this one closely as it develops.

Leah: Moving on, we've got a couple of stories that highlight some serious social issues. The first is a heartbreaking report about a woman who died after municipal workers allegedly demanded a bribe to stop sewage from flooding her home. This situation shows, once again, the deep-seated corruption that has continued to plague the country.

And in the Eastern Cape town of Matatiele, there's a disturbing story about a town where rape is sadly, considered a sentence served by women. Sexual violence is disturbingly prevalent and deeply concerning, as are reports of child rape.

Leah: Let's turn our attention to the economy. In one town in the Western Cape, house prices have jumped significantly, from R400,000 to R1.25 million. This indicates some growth in certain areas, while, at the same time, highlighting how expensive things can be.

Also, new developments have been happening in the real estate market, with several real estate investment trusts (REITs) reporting some positive results. Growthpoint, South Africa's largest landlord, saw better-than-expected results, and there’s optimism, and some are expanding plans. Building confidence is key to building the economy.

Leah: Now for some good news! Scientists from the University of KwaZulu-Natal have released promising results from the first HIV cure trial in Africa. They’ve seen viral suppression in a group of women who stopped taking antiretroviral therapy. It's not a cure, but it's a significant step forward. We are so excited to see what the next developments could be!

Leah: Finally, some news that might make your wallet hurt. There’s a story about the price pain for those who have solar in South Africa. On top of that, there’s also the fact that the US is imposing tariffs on South African products. These are some big problems, and it’s important to stay informed about how these issues could impact your daily life.

And that's all the time we have for today's Mzansi Lowdown. Thanks for tuning in. Be sure to check out the links in our show notes for more information on these stories.
