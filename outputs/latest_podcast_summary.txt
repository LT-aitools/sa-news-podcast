Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Monday, August eleventh, 2025. Let's get right into it.

Our top story today concerns the ongoing controversy surrounding Sports Minister Gayton McKenzie.

Multiple sources, including IOL, Daily Maverick, and eNCA, are reporting on the outrage sparked by resurfaced social media posts where Minister McKenzie allegedly used the K-word. The Economic Freedom Fighters, or EFF, is calling for his immediate removal from his ministerial position. Minister McKenzie has since apologized, calling himself a "troll" for the posts. However, this incident brings up questions about whether this is a political campaign against him, or is the public's outrage genuine? The news outlets also mentioned how his use of the K-word is unlikely to damage his standing within the Patriotic Alliance, or PA, the party McKenzie is part of.

Next up, we have a developing story about the National Dialogue.

News24 reports that the Anglican Archbishop has stated that the National Dialogue "cannot fail," emphasizing its importance for South Africa. However, other outlets, such as Daily Maverick, are reporting on the National Dialogue’s faltering, with some suggesting that perhaps there may be a better way forward. Furthermore, eNCA notes that despite divisions, the convention is still going ahead. IOL also reports that former president Thabo Mbeki withdrew from the dialogue due to concerns over the approximately seven hundred million rand budget.
