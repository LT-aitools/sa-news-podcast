Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Saturday, the nineteenth of July, in the year two thousand and twenty-five.

Let's dive straight into the headlines.

Our lead story today focuses on the South African National Defence Force, or SANDF. The head of the South African Navy has accused the National Treasury of sabotaging the SANDF, claiming national security is at risk. This follows various reports highlighting concerns about underfunding within the Defence Force. The core issue appears to be budgetary constraints. There are reports that the defence budget may be difficult to justify without a solid national security strategy, further compounding the problems. The Navy Chief’s statement underscores a potential crisis that requires immediate attention.

Highlighting themes that include how the failure of the government to deliver basic services is a betrayal of Nelson Mandela's legacy. This anniversary serves as a reminder to disrupt injustice, a call to action echoing Mandela's own approach.

Other reports have indicated that the board has been turbocharging to track business operations.
