**Leah:** Cracks are deepening in the partnership between the ANC and the DA. As reported by Ferial Haffajee, the ANC is lashing out at the DA over recent actions, causing a serious strain on their collaboration. This comes as President Ramaphosa pushes back against pressure from the business sector, adding another layer of complexity to the situation. The ANCâ€™s chief whip has even called for consequences for the DA. This is certainly a developing story that we will continue to monitor closely.

**Leah:** Next up, a story that impacts all South Africans: the ongoing issue of education. According to recent reports, Minister of Basic Education, has admitted to failing to meet the deadline to eradicate pit toilets at South African schools. This is a massive issue, especially considering how many learners and educators across the country are affected by the dangerous conditions of pit latrines. This is a key reminder of the essential role of government and the need for accountability in improving infrastructure.

This, unfortunately, is a reminder of the dangers and challenges that need to be addressed.
