Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Wednesday, the third of September, two thousand and twenty-five. Let's dive right in.

Our top stories today: We start with a Joburg MMC in the Hawks' crosshairs, followed by the ongoing legal battle of Vusimuzi ‘Cat’ Matlala, then we'll talk about the political shake-up in Limpopo, and finally, we will look at the recent focus on the safety of SA's tourism and the issues with the South African Tourism board.

First up, a Joburg MMC is under investigation by the Hawks, the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation, regarding alleged “facilitation fees” totaling one hundred and eighty-six thousand rand, received from a housing developer. The Hawks have confirmed their interest in the matter, and investigations are ongoing. This comes as part of ongoing efforts to combat corruption in local government, where several officials are being scrutinized.

Next, the legal saga surrounding businessman Vusimuzi ‘Cat’ Matlala continues to unfold. New developments suggest his ex-girlfriend sought protection after an alleged attempted hit. Several news outlets are reporting on this, including the claims that Matlala's ex-girlfriend, Tebogo Thobejane, sought his protection after an alleged attempted hit on her life. Brown Mogotsi’s secret prison phone calls to Matlala are also being investigated. Additionally, the National Prosecuting Authority is now linking Matlala’s payments to a co-accused to the alleged hit on his ex-lover. The businessman is expected in court for a formal bail application.

In Limpopo, the political landscape is shifting. Stan Mathabatha has announced his intention to step down as the African National Congress, or ANC, chairperson in the province. The announcement has sparked reactions from various quarters, including the African National Congress Youth League, or ANCYL, which has criticized Mathabatha's decision. While reasons for his resignation are still emerging, the move is anticipated to cause significant changes within the ANC structures of Limpopo.

Finally, the South African Tourism board is facing further scrutiny. Minister Patricia de Lille is under fire following her decision to dissolve the board. Criticism arises amid concerns about legal and fiscal breaches. De Lille defends the dissolution, stating there is no crisis at SA Tourism, though some members of Parliament are asking her directly about corruption.

The South African Tourism board's leadership and governance are also under scrutiny with the beginning of Tourism Month in South Africa.
