Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I'm your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Tuesday, May 6th, 2025, in South Africa. Let's jump right into the headlines.

Our top story today concerns the Eastern Cape Division of the High Court in Mthatha. The Southern Africa Accountability Journalism Project has corroborated allegations of systemic corruption within the court. Officials are accused of soliciting bribes from attorneys in exchange for performing routine administrative tasks. This is a significant development, pointing to deep-seated issues within the judicial system.

Next, we have a critical development regarding the ongoing debate over the Employment Equity Act. The Democratic Alliance, or DA, is strongly criticizing the legislation, arguing it is detrimental to minorities in provinces like KwaZulu-Natal and the Western Cape. This has ignited a major disagreement within the Government of National Unity, or GNU. The ANC has responded, reigniting a fundamental dispute over how transformation should be implemented in South Africa. This has the potential to significantly impact the direction of South African labour policy and create political instability.
