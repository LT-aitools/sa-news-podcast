Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Tuesday, August 12th, 2025. Let's jump straight into the headlines.

Our top story today revolves around Operation Dudula and its ongoing actions. The group has demanded a meeting with Minister of Health, Dr. Joe Phaahla, after an attempt to shut down a clinic. Recent reports indicate Operation Dudula disregarded warnings and has occupied a Soweto clinic again. Concerns have been raised by Médecins Sans Frontières Southern Africa, who state these actions put the lives of non-South African patients at risk. The South African Broadcasting Corporation has reported that the Department of Health condemns Operation Dudula’s clinic protests. This situation continues to develop, and we will continue to provide updates as they become available.

Next up, we look at political discourse. The Democratic Alliance, or DA, is criticizing the government's national dialogue. DA leader John Steenhuisen has stated that South Africa is in the ICU, and President Cyril Ramaphosa is delivering a national monologue. Steenhuisen contends that action, not talk, is what is necessary to get the economy moving. The DA also slammed the R700 million national dialogue, calling it a pricey 'talk shop'. In related news, the DA is unveiling reforms to transform policies aimed at strengthening State-Owned Enterprises, or SOEs. The party is arguing for an end to Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment, or BEE, and expropriation.
