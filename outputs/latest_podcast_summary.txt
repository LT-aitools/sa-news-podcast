Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Wednesday, the eleventh of June, two thousand and twenty-five, and these are the headlines.

Our top story today focuses on the severe weather battering the country. A cut-off low system continues to bring snow, flooding, and freezing temperatures, causing widespread chaos and hardship. The Eastern Cape is bearing the brunt of the storm, with an Orange Level 9 warning issued for severe disruptive rain. Reports indicate severe flooding, with multiple fatalities and a search underway for missing schoolchildren. The N10 in the Eastern Cape was shut down for eight hours due to a head-on collision involving two trucks, further exacerbating the disruption. Motorists are urged to exercise extreme caution on the roads.

Turning to the automotive industry, South Africa's vehicle sector faces a crossroads. A surge in local car sales was reported in May, but a sharp contraction in exports and rising global tariff tensions are creating pressure. In a positive development, Naamsa, the Automotive Business Council, announced that Auto Week 2025 will be held in Gqeberha, Nelson Mandela Bay, from the first to the third of October. News of the R twenty million rand Rolls-Royce Spectre Black Badge which has arrived in South Africa, with its first local delivery, has also been making waves.
