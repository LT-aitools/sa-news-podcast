Leah: Sawubona South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I'm your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Monday, the 7th of April, 2025, and we've got a packed agenda to get through. Let’s dive right in.

First up, we’re looking at the growing tensions within the coalition government. **Transition music**

Leah: Cracks are deepening, folks. The ANC is really lashing out at the DA over some recent missteps. President Ramaphosa is pushing back against pressure from the business sector, showing just how fragile this partnership has become. The ANC's chief whip has even called for consequences for the DA, signaling a real shift in the power dynamics. This could mean some significant changes are coming to how the government operates, and perhaps even a complete shake-up in the future. We will keep you updated on this, as we gather more information.

Leah: In other news, we have an update on that terrible case of the missing child, Joshlin Smith. The search has, unfortunately, turned into a social media circus, with inaccurate information being spread, and the work of the police being hampered. It’s really important to remember that behind every news story, there are real people, and real pain. Remember to approach stories like this with sensitivity.

Leah: Moving on to something a bit different, a story of infrastructure and power. Public Works and Infrastructure Minister Dean Macpherson is calling for lifestyle audits into the bosses of the Independent Development Trust, or IDT. He’s also provided an update on the delayed oxygen plant probe. This is an investigation into an R836 million deal and seems to be facing several roadblocks. Macpherson says the investigation should be concluded by May. We’ll continue to watch this story, as it unfolds.

Leah: And now, a quick heads-up: authorities have opened a fifth sluice gate at the Vaal Dam due to the incredibly high water levels. This is a major cause for concern, and the rising water levels have prompted urgent warnings for communities in low-lying areas. Authorities are urging people to evacuate because of the risk of overflowing riverbanks. This means we have a situation that could cause some serious damage. We will be monitoring the situation for you and bring you the latest updates.

**Transition music**

Leah: Finally, let’s turn to the story of South African medical research, which is a real point of pride for us. South Africa has world-class medical researchers, but the sudden and severe US cuts to grants from the world’s largest health research funder threaten to unravel that landscape. It raises a very important question: will the government turn this crisis into an opportunity to give a helping hand? It's a crucial time for us in the scientific community, and we'll be watching closely to see how the government responds.

**Transition music**

Leah: That's all for today's Mzansi Lowdown. Thanks for tuning in. We’ll be back tomorrow with the latest updates.
