Leah: Sawubona South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I'm your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Friday, April 18th, 2025, and here's your news brief.

First up: The looming VAT hike.

Despite pressure to scrap the proposed 0.5% VAT increase by the 1st of May, it's looking increasingly unlikely. Rise Mzansi leader Songezo Zibi says it's just not practically feasible, particularly with the parliamentary constituency period underway, and the window to amend the fiscal framework having closed, for now. Finance Minister Godongwana defends the increase, saying there will be "severe consequences" if it is suspended. The article in Daily Maverick says a challenge to Section 7(4) of the VAT Act by the DA is ‘misdirected’ and based on a misinterpretation of the law. The government argues that if the hike is cancelled, it will lead to more debt and spending cuts.

Leah: Next, a focus on crime and safety.

The Eastern Cape is in the news with the rescue of an American pastor, who had been kidnapped. The US Embassy has lauded the South African Police Service for their rescue of the pastor, who was abducted during a sermon. Following a shootout with the kidnappers, the pastor was rescued, and the kidnappers were killed.

In other crime news, the trial continues in the Joshlin Smith kidnapping case. The state is seeking to discredit the accused's claims of police brutality, and the trial-within-a-trial judgment is expected soon.
Furthermore, in KwaZulu-Natal, two individuals were apprehended with the help of anti-crime software.

Leah: Next up, let's talk about developments in education.

A man has been arrested in the fatal shooting of a Walter Sisulu University student. Minister of Higher Education and Training, Dr. Nobuhle Nkabane, has confirmed that the deceased was a student from the institution. The Department of Higher Education has established a committee to assess student accommodation challenges.

Leah: Now, let's move on to the economy.

South Africa is facing tough economic conditions but is not out of the race, according to multiple reports. In recent news articles, there is concern regarding the high interest rates in South Africa, and how the triple trade shock could shave off 0.7% from the growth in the Reserve Bank’s downside scenario. Investors are still attracted to South Africa, according to Reuters.

Also in the news, Mediclinic is responding to reports of job cuts connected to its artificial intelligence strategy, and in a formal statement, it has been confirmed that there is no specific directive where AI is being implemented to replace permanent employees.

Leah: And finally, before we go:

The flu season is arriving early in South Africa. According to health experts, and the National Institute for Communicable Diseases, it's essential to get vaccinated to protect yourself and your loved ones, as a flu season has now started.

That’s all the time we have for today.
