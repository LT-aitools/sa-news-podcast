Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Wednesday, the eighteenth of June, two thousand and twenty-five. Let's get straight into the top stories.

Our first story focuses on government spending. The South African cabinet has been under scrutiny for its travel expenses, with reports revealing that members spent a staggering two hundred and two million rand of taxpayer money on travel in just one year. **Transition music** This has sparked considerable debate, especially regarding the costs of international trips, such as Deputy President Paul Mashatile’s accommodation in Tokyo, which reportedly cost nine hundred thousand rand for four nights. While the Office of the Deputy President has provided some clarification, other ministers, like Minister Ntshavheni, have opted not to disclose their official travel expenses, citing security reasons. This lack of transparency and the scale of spending continue to draw criticism.

Next, we shift to the political arena where ActionSA has released a report card on the Government of National Unity, awarding it with four Fs. This comes as the GNU approaches its first anniversary. The report highlights areas where the government is perceived to be failing. **Transition music** There is significant friction amongst the parties involved in this alliance, and there have been discussions, though ultimately unsuccessful, about ActionSA joining the GNU. Despite the difficulties, some observers do note some green shoots of progress, even if the overall assessment from ActionSA is negative.

In a separate story, we look at the National Prosecuting Authority, or NPA, and its head, Shamila Batohi. She has stated that she will not be stepping down amid pressure from various political factions, including the Economic Freedom Fighters, or EFF, and the uMkhonto we Sizwe Party, or MK Party. Batohi maintains that the NPA is doing a "fantastic job," despite criticism over its ability to successfully prosecute individuals implicated in state capture. ActionSA, in particular, has expressed concern about the NPA's performance, particularly the cases it has lost. **Transition music** The situation highlights ongoing political pressures and scrutiny faced by the NPA in its efforts to address corruption and bring justice.

Turning our attention to education, a teachers' strike in KwaZulu-Natal has led to significant disruptions to June examinations. KZN Premier has intervened in an attempt to resolve the strike and ensure the exams can proceed. While the Premier is attempting to resolve the situation, there have been varying reports regarding the postponement of exams, with some schools postponing them and other unions denying that any such instructions were provided. **Transition music** The developments have caused concern among parents.

Finally, we will touch on the matter of power. South Africa’s ongoing energy challenges are highlighting the need for more alternatives to the nation’s power grid. We look at a less well-known company which is aiming to disrupt Eskom’s existing monopoly. This little-known company seeks to participate in South Africa's energy market, potentially offering competition to the established power utility. **Transition music** The move represents a significant shift in South Africa’s approach to its energy future, and the government is seeking ways to speed up private sector involvement in grid infrastructure.
