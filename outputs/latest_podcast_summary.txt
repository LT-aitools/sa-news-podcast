Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I'm your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Tuesday, May 27th, 2025, and here's what's making headlines:

Our top story today concerns allegations of corruption at the Eastern Cape Division of the High Court in Mthatha. The Southern Africa Accountability Journalism Project has corroborated claims that court officials are soliciting bribes from attorneys. These bribes are being demanded in exchange for performing routine administrative functions. This is a serious development, raising concerns about the integrity of the judicial system.

Next up, let’s turn to a major financial issue in Johannesburg. City Power, the city's electricity provider, is facing a sixteen point three billion rand crisis. News24 reports that the mayor is allegedly withholding reports related to the crisis. This situation could lead to financial ruin for the utility, which is a vital service for the city. This is sure to have significant implications for residents and businesses in Johannesburg.

Now, a concerning development in the Eastern Cape. Xenophobic violence has broken out in Addo, following a murder. Three people have died, and at least ten others are seriously injured in what is being reported as revenge attacks. Additional members from specialised units have been deployed to the area. This is a tragic situation and highlights the ongoing challenges of xenophobia in South Africa.

Moving on to another important development, South Africa is launching a new state-owned enterprise (SOE) in the petroleum sector. The newly-formed South African National Petroleum Company, or SANPC, is now open for business. The aim is to enhance the country's oil refinery capabilities and boost the energy sector. SANPC is also looking into leasing refinery sites. This is a significant move to revive the energy sector and reduce reliance on foreign oil suppliers.

In other news, the Joshlin Smith case continues, and sentencing proceedings are underway. The state is set to call for life imprisonment for those convicted. Sentencing proceedings began in Saldanha Bay on Tuesday. It is unclear whether the defence will call witnesses or take the stand. We'll be following this case as it develops.

Finally, let's look at the retail sector. Pick n Pay's CEO says the company won't be the biggest retailer anymore, and that's fine. Losses are shrinking at Pick n Pay amid a recovery push. They are aiming for profitability by two thousand twenty-eight, through a turnaround strategy that may see them shrink in size.
