Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I'm your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Saturday, April 26th, 2025.

Let's dive right in.

Our top story today concerns the government’s handling of the proposed VAT increase. After a flurry of activity this week, the VAT hike, announced seemingly out of the blue, has been walked back. Various political parties are now scrambling to take credit for forcing the ANC to reverse its decision. The Daily Maverick is reporting that many parties, from Bosa to the FF+, are claiming victory. However, it’s believed this reversal is likely an attempt to stabilize the existing Government of National Unity.

Next, we look at the visit of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. His visit to South Africa generated unprecedented levels of diplomatic interest. However, his trip was cut short as he had to unexpectedly return to Kyiv following a massive Russian attack on the Ukrainian capital. As talks continue, there's a prevailing sentiment that Moscow's actions don't match its words regarding a peaceful resolution.

In other news, South Africa is feeling the impact of load shedding. Parts of Gauteng, particularly Tshwane East, have been without power since yesterday afternoon, and some areas of Johannesburg have been in the dark for over thirty-eight hours. Despite the ongoing power cuts, Eskom has stated that it has a comprehensive winter plan in place.

Turning to legal matters, former President Jacob Zuma is claiming the arms deal corruption charges against him should be dropped.  Court proceedings saw Zuma's bid to remove the State prosecutor, Billy Downer, from the long-running Arms Deal case denied.  Naledi Sikhakhane reports that Zuma is rallying supporters, claiming the dismissal of charges and criticising the Government of National Unity's recent VAT increase proposal. The case has dragged on so long that the death of several witnesses could potentially lead to the charges being dropped.

Finally, a story of community involvement. Shark Spotters is taking a new approach to managing human-wildlife conflict in Cape Town. Led by Sarah Waries, the organization, which has been monitoring the ocean for over two decades, is now expanding its efforts to the mountains and suburbs of the southern Peninsula, where they'll be focusing on baboons.
