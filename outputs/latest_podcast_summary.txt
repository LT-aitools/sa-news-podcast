Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah.

Today is Wednesday, the twenty-seventh of August, twenty twenty-five, and here's what's making headlines:

First up, we have the ongoing saga of the Madlanga Commission. The Department of Justice’s infrastructure procurement fumbles are causing significant delays, stalling the commission's public hearings. Investigations into police corruption are at a standstill because of the lack of promised infrastructure. Minister Kubayi has suspended top justice department officials as a result. The commission was created to investigate corruption in the police force.

Staying in the justice sector, the Public Service Commission has been asked by Buti Manamela to probe his own appointments of three controversial Sector Education and Training Authority administrators. There is no further information available at this time.

In other news, Nelson Mandela Bay is struggling with crime. Despite Executive Mayor Babalwa Lobishe delivering an upbeat report on Tuesday on plans to combat crime, opposition parties met this with derision. The city admitted it has no funds to implement these crime-fighting strategies.

Now, to some socio-political news: the government is under fire for several reasons. In a survey, the GovDem survey revealed a deepening distrust of African immigrants is an alarm bell. The choice before us is stark. Either we allow distrust to deepen, normalising xenophobia as state policy, or we confront it now with courage and clarity.

Now, a piece about economic news: The government has chosen a risky approach to global politics. The country has chosen strategic autonomy as its response to the complexity and instability of global affairs, but it does not have what it takes to navigate such a stance successfully.

In a turn of events, former Johannesburg Property Company boss Helen Botes is still working for the City of Joburg, despite them saying she had left. She was seen in a "bomb squad" meeting the day after.
