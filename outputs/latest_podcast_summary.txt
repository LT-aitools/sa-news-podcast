**Leah:** Our top story today concerns the ongoing political drama surrounding South Africa's government of national unity, or GNU. The DA is willing to speak to the ANC in order to get a workable budget on the table. This comes amidst rising tensions and disagreements over the recent fiscal framework. It seems the political landscape is still shifting, and finding common ground will be a challenge. 

**Leah:** The budget itself is under scrutiny, with discussions ongoing about potential alternatives to the proposed VAT hike. The ANC is searching for alternatives, but the situation is proving difficult. It's a crucial time for the country, with the budget impacting many aspects of life here in South Africa.

**Leah:** Next up, we have a deeply troubling story from Soweto. Three taxi association members were gunned down in the area this morning. This incident is linked to a brutal war between rival taxi associations that has been going on for nearly a decade, and has prompted shock and concern from the Wata taxi association. More details are still emerging, but this tragic event highlights the ongoing violence within the industry.

**Leah:** Now, let's turn to a story that shines a light on the darker side of our society. It's about a coordinated strategy by police to extract information in a kidnapping case, which is discussed in detail in a Daily Maverick article. The police employed a strategic approach to question suspects Jacquen Appollis and Steveno van Rhyn, and this led to a significant breakthrough in the investigation. While details of the case are still emerging, the use of these tactics is a reminder of the lengths investigators sometimes have to go to in order to solve heinous crimes.

**Leah:** Shifting gears, a new report from energy think tank Ember states that renewable energy provided a record thirty-two percent of global electricity last year, which is up from thirty-one percent in 2023. According to the report, overall electricity demand grew four percent. This reflects the increasing importance of renewables globally. With concerns about the environment and the potential impact of a global trade war and potential recession on demand for renewables, South Africa could see investment in renewables increase.

**Leah:** Sadly, we also have a story concerning the disappearance and discovery of a seven-year-old boy's body in Cato Manor. The search has ended tragically, and investigations are underway.

**Leah:** Finally, some stories from the past have been brought to light again. Twenty-five years ago, on the seventh of April, Hansie Cronje, the South African cricket captain, was accused of match-fixing. The scandal, which originated in India, has continued to affect sport for a quarter of a century. In a world of tech-savvy global sport corruptors, this case reminds us that the fight against corruption is far from over.

**Leah:** That's all for today's Mzansi Lowdown. Join us again tomorrow for your daily update on what's happening in South Africa.
