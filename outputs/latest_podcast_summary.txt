Our next story focuses on the South African National Defence Force, or SANDF, and its Chief, General Rudzani Maphwanya. News24 reports that Maphwanya faces calls to resign, just four months before his retirement. The controversy stems from remarks made by Maphwanya that have been perceived as supportive of Iran. Al Jazeera and other news outlets have also weighed in, questioning the General's stance and the potential diplomatic fallout. The DA is demanding a court-martial for the SANDF Chief, citing a breach of military neutrality. President Ramaphosa's office has stated that the visit to Iran was "ill-advised." This situation places Maphwanya in a precarious position, with his leadership and potential retirement plans now under intense scrutiny.
