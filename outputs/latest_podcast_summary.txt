Leah: Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Saturday, June 7th, 2025. Let's get straight to the headlines.

Our first story focuses on the South African Rugby Union. News24 reports that SARU seems to be sidestepping the findings of a PwC investigation in order to discipline its CEO, Rian Oberholzer, in relation to the failed Ackerley deal. The article suggests that the disciplinary action is taking place despite the results of the PwC probe, although specifics are not yet available.

Our fourth story regards the political landscape. SABC News reports that Jacob Zuma and Duduzile Zuma-Sambudla have stated there is no instability within the MK Party, despite recent reshuffles. This statement comes amidst reports of internal changes. Several sources including News24 and EWN, also report on Floyd Shivambu's redeployment from Parliament to the MK Party, and Malema's doubts regarding Shivambu's redeployment, and the impact it will have on the party's performance. The reshuffle is clearly a talking point.

Finally, we have a significant story about the economy. SowetanLIVE is reporting that GNU ministers have spent approximately two hundred million rand of taxpayers' money on travel expenses since taking office. ActionSA is the source for this figure. Additionally, The Citizen reports on Paul Mashatile's travel expenses for a trip to Japan, which were estimated at two point three million rand for travel, food, and laundry, and MSN reports that taxpayers coughed up one million rand for his hotel in Japan. This has raised public concern about government spending during these challenging economic times.
