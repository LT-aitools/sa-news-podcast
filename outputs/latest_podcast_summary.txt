Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Sunday, the 20th of July, 2025. Let's dive straight into the headlines.

Our top stories today: the ongoing police crisis, the US rejection of a South African envoy, the legal battles surrounding the former President, and an important update on the George building collapse.

First up, the police force is under the microscope. News24 reports that President Ramaphosa has failed to act on two previous reports detailing issues within the South African Police Service. This news comes at a time when there are also reports of a criminal investigation involving Mchunu, and concerns from crime experts about the Minister of Police’s short term in office. The Democratic Alliance is also revealing details regarding a criminal investigation into a senior official, adding to the pressure for reform and action.

Next, we have an important development in international relations. News24 is reporting that the United States informed South Africa as early as May that they reject Jonas Mcebisi as the country’s envoy. This rejection, coupled with the fact that Mr. Mcebisi was "shunned", and the US has denied him a visa, signals a growing tension in relations between South Africa and the US. There are also claims that the South African judiciary is too tainted to investigate the allegations, making the situation even more complex.

Shifting gears, we have some movement in the legal arena. Jacob Zuma and the MK Party are challenging President Ramaphosa's decisions in the apex court. They are contesting his decision to suspend Mchunu. Additionally, the MK Party is considering a no-confidence motion against President Ramaphosa over the SAPS crisis. This all comes as legal action is ongoing regarding the appointment of an acting police minister.

The BBC reports that the building collapse, which resulted in the deaths of thirty-four people, was preventable, according to the Minister. The eNCA also highlights that the findings of the investigation are alarming, and TimesLIVE shares details about the Public Works Minister providing feedback.
