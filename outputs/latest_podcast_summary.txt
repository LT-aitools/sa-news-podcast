Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Friday, the sixth of June, 2025. Let's dive right in.

First up, we have some political developments. President Cyril Ramaphosa is taking Higher Education Minister, Naledi Pandor, to task over her conduct in Parliament. This follows concerns about her behavior during parliamentary sessions and also regarding appointments to the Sector Education and Training Authorities, or SETAs. The President expects members of the executive to conduct themselves professionally and transparently when engaging with Parliament. Meanwhile, there is also controversy surrounding the Minister's attitude. She has promised to lead with humility, following the President's rebuke.

Next, we have news from the economic front. South Africa faces a concerning economic outlook. Experts and institutions are warning of potential stagnation if critical structural reforms are not implemented swiftly. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, or OECD, along with various banks and business leaders, have voiced their concerns. Several reports indicate that South Africa's economy is significantly smaller than it could have been had it kept pace with its peers over the past decade. Some estimates suggest that the country has lost years of economic growth, with the economy potentially being thirty-seven percent smaller than it could have been.

Moving on, there is news of a major scandal in the education sector. A teacher has been fired for allegedly awarding marks to pupils based on their "body shape." This incident has sparked outrage and raises serious questions about fairness and ethical conduct in the classroom. The teacher's actions, if proven, represent a gross misconduct and a violation of professional standards. Further details about this case are still emerging.

Now for a bit of local government happenings. The Mayor of Johannesburg, Dada Morero, has announced the formation of a special team, or what they call a "bomb squad," of experienced veterans to tackle the challenges facing the city. The aim is to revitalize the City of Gold. However, the opposition party, the Democratic Alliance, or DA, has criticized this move, calling it a ploy to benefit the African National Congress, or ANC, cadres. The new team is expected to address issues such as service delivery and corruption.

Finally, we have a legal matter related to a high-value purchase. A man is in a legal battle with a dealership after paying over two hundred and sixty-nine thousand rand to fix a faulty Ferrari just five months after buying it. This case highlights consumer rights and the importance of ensuring that high-value purchases meet expected standards. The details of the car's defects, the repair attempts, and the legal arguments are currently being presented in court.
