Moving on to a legal matter that could significantly impact the current administration. The Daily Maverick has reported that the Constitutional Court is set to rule on President Cyril Ramaphosa's decision to place Minister of Public Service and Administration, Noxolo Kiviet, on leave. Several sources, including News24 and BusinessLIVE, have provided differing perspectives on this case. The MK Party claims that Ramaphosa does not possess the authority to place Kiviet on special leave. Meanwhile, Ramaphosa’s legal team argues that probing claims against Kiviet would enable a dismissal in line with the Constitution. The ruling from the Constitutional Court is eagerly awaited and is expected to have significant repercussions.
