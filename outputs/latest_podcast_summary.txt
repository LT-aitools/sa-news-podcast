Next up, we turn to politics, where the death of former Deputy President David Mabuza has sparked a flurry of reactions and controversies.

Multiple sources, including TimesLIVE and the Daily Maverick, have reported on the passing of David Mabuza. However, a key aspect of this story is the reaction to how the news was handled. TimesLIVE reports that Minister Fikile Mbalula is taking flak for flouting protocol and announcing Mabuza’s death early. Several articles highlight how the news was on social media before the President had a chance to officially brief the nation. This event has generated significant discussion about the procedures for communicating high-profile deaths within the government, along with the overall handling of such important matters. Various outlets also shared statements from President Cyril Ramaphosa and the South African Human Rights Commission, emphasizing Mabuza’s contributions to children's rights.

In other political developments, we have a story about the fallout from the DA’s withdrawal from the national dialogue.

The Democratic Alliance, or DA, has decided to pull out of the national dialogue, sparking criticism and a war of words between the DA and the ANC. Articles from News24 and IOL report on the reactions of both sides, including criticism from former President Thabo Mbeki, as well as response from DA leader John Steenhuisen. Steenhuisen has been quoted in various news sources, including News24, saying the dialogue is just a "lot of talking". This move could potentially trigger the collapse of the Government of National Unity, or GNU.
