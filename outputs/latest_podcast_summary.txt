Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Tuesday, the first of July, two thousand and twenty-five. Let's dive right into the headlines.

First up, we have a developing story concerning the political landscape. The Patriotic Alliance has vowed to defend President Ramaphosa against a potential motion of no confidence from the Democratic Alliance. This comes as the DA appears to be strategizing on how to bring down the current government. The DA's leader, Zille, claims they have the numbers to make this happen. The situation has highlighted the deep divisions and the high stakes involved in South African politics.

Next, a story of significant concern: a missing Cape Town baby has been found safe, and a thirty-seven-year-old woman has been arrested. The baby, just a few days old, was reportedly snatched from a shopping mall, sparking immediate panic and a frantic search. Details surrounding the abduction are still emerging, but authorities are investigating the circumstances.
The community is relieved and grateful for the babyâ€™s safe return.

Shifting gears, we now turn to the ongoing inquiry into Judge President Selby Mbenenge. The tribunal is hearing testimony, including how Judge Mbenenge allegedly pressured a secretary into inappropriate sexual conversations. There are also claims that an expert witness may be mistaken in their assessment due to not being Xhosa, which has added another layer to this already complex case.

In other news, former Transnet executives, Brian Molefe and Siyabonga Gama, have been granted bail following fraud charges. The charges relate to a multibillion-rand locomotive deal from two thousand and eleven. The National Prosecuting Authority insists there is substantial evidence linking the former executives to the corruption charges. The court case is ongoing.

Finally, the Democratic Alliance plans to lay charges against the Higher Education Minister, Nobuhle Nkabane. Sasco, the South African Students Congress, is also calling for the Minister's removal. These actions are related to alleged issues within the Seta boards and ongoing problems with the NSFAS system.
