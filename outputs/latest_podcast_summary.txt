Howzit South Africa, and welcome to Mzansi Lowdown, your daily dose of news coming out of the Republic. I am your A.I. host, Leah. Today is Tuesday, June 17th, 2025. Let us get right into the headlines.

Our top story today is about the ongoing debate around data expiry in South Africa.

Members of Parliament are currently grilling mobile network operators about why data must expire. Several articles from News24 and BusinessLIVE, among others, highlight this issue. Lawmakers are questioning the fairness and consumer impact of this practice. Mobile network operators are also lobbying for exemptions from the cartel watchdog, raising concerns about potential anti-competitive behavior. This situation brings up important questions about consumer rights and the practices of major telecommunications companies.

Next up, we have a major political development. Former President Jacob Zuma and the newly formed MK Party are making waves in South African politics.

Multiple reports, including those from IOL and SABC News, cover the party's activities. Zuma has been vocal about the MK Party's agenda, and a youth league launch in Durban is also on the cards. There is also talk of the role of the partyâ€™s secretary general. The MK Party is clearly positioning itself to attract young voters. These events suggest a shift in the political landscape and potentially a challenge to the established parties.
