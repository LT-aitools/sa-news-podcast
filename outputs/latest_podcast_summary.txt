Next up: The National Prosecuting Authority, or NPA, has issued a warning that thousands of extradited criminals may have their cases thrown out due to a legal technicality. The NPA is requesting the Constitutional Court to intervene urgently in this matter. They fear that if the court does not act, a significant number of individuals who have been extradited to South Africa to face trial could potentially be released. This situation highlights the importance of proper legal processes.

In other news, there is growing international interest in South Africa's stance on various global issues. ZANU-PF, the ruling party of Zimbabwe, has warned South Africa against supporting US sanctions and has cautioned against the influence of former US President Donald Trump. Meanwhile, President Ramaphosa is responding to growing calls for sanctions against South Africa. This comes after an increased focus on South Africa's relationship with Russia and its actions related to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. The situation is creating diplomatic tensions.
